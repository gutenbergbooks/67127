  <h2 class='c004'>INTRODUCTORY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Specializations have been characteristic of the present generation. Branches
of science, philosophy or art have been selected and treated as though possessed
of great and independent importance. The process of individuality has been the
cause; but true evolution, whether in man or matter, consists in viewing whatever
is presented for consideration as being related to all the rest, and as a part of the
whole.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be evident to the careful reader that the various subjects contained in
this volume were not originally prepared for this purpose. In several instances
the same points receive consideration, which, while they perhaps interfere with the
general consecutiveness of the entire work, would interfere still more with the construction
of its parts, were they omitted. For this we have no other apology to
offer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Perhaps, however, an explanation is due for errors which have undoubtedly
been passed unnoticed. During the publication we have been variously engaged
and not able to devote the time actually requisite to reviewing a work of this
character. Very much of the proof-reading has necessarily been intrusted to
others, and we regret that some typographical errors have crept in. Those we
have noticed are so evident they scarcely need be mentioned. In one case evolution
has been rendered revolution; in another, evolve, revolve; in another, farce,
force, etc. All who might desire to read part of this book may not care for other
parts. Those who would find food for thought in “The Basis of Physical Life”
might not care to inquire whether the governmental evolution of the world has
been consistent and persistent; but we trust that everybody who takes up this
book will carefully read “The Limits and Sphere and the Principles of Government,”
and “Papers on Labor and Capital and Commerce,” for these immediately
concern us all.</p>

<p class='c008'>In introducing the Constitution of the United States and the late action in reference
to human rights, it is hoped to meet in a manner the rapidly-growing demand
for information upon the Woman Question, and in giving it the prominence of
introducing the book to our readers, we trust to cause further inquiry into the
subject of the equality of human rights. Asking the indulgence of an ever generous
public we commit our effort to its care, with the hope that the Providence
of God may approve it, and that it may benefit that humanity in whose cause I
profess to labor.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c010'>ARTICLE I.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sec. I.</span>—All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested
in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and
House of Representatives.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sec. II.</span>—1. The House of Representatives shall be composed of
members chosen every second year, by the people of the several
States; and the electors in each State shall have the qualifications
requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State Legislature.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained
the age of twenty-five years and been seven years a citizen of the
United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of the
State in which he shall be chosen.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the
several States which may be included within this Union, according to
their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the
whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a
term of years, and excluding Indians, not taxed, three-fifths of all
other persons. The actual enumeration shall be made within three
years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and
within every subsequent term of ten years in such manner as they shall
by law direct. The number of Representatives shall not exceed one
for every thirty thousand, but each State shall have at least one Representative;
and until such enumeration shall be made the State of New
Hampshire shall be entitled to choose three; Massachusetts, eight;
Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, one; Connecticut, five; New
York, six; New Jersey, four; Pennsylvania, eight; Delaware, one;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Maryland, six; Virginia, ten; North Carolina, five; South Carolina
five, and Georgia, three.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. When vacancies happen in the representation from any State, the
executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to fill such
vacancies.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. The House of Representatives shall choose their Speaker and
other officers, and shall have the sole power of impeachment.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sec. III.</span>—1. The Senate of the United States shall be composed
two Senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof, for
six years; and each Senator shall have one vote.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the
first election, they shall be divided, as equally as may be, into three classes.
The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration
of the second year, of the second class at the expiration of the
fourth year, and of the third class at the expiration of the sixth year,
that one-third maybe chosen every second year; and, if vacancies
occur by resignation or otherwise, during the recess of the Legislature
of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary appointments
until the next meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such
vacancies.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained the
age of thirty years, and been nine years a citizen of the United States,
and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that State for
which he is chosen.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. The Vice-President of the United States shall be President of
the Senate, but shall have no vote unless they be equally divided.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. The Senate shall choose their other officers and also a President
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tempore</span></i>, in the absence of the Vice-President or when he shall exercise
the office of the President of the United States.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.
When sitting for that purpose they shall be on oath or affirmation.
When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice
shall preside; and no person shall be convicted without the concurrence
of two-thirds of the members present.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend farther
than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any
office of honor, trust or profit under the United States; but the party
convicted shall, nevertheless, be liable and subject to indictment, trial,
judgment and punishment according to law.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span><span class='sc'>Sec. IV.</span>—1. The times, places and manner of holding elections
for Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each State, by
the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may, at any time, by law,
make or alter such regulation, except as to the places of choosing Senators.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year; and
such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they
shall by law appoint a different day.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sec. V.</span>—1. Each House shall be judge of the elections, returns
and qualifications of its own members; and a majority of each shall
constitute a quorum to do business, but a smaller number may adjourn
from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the attendance of
absent members, in such manner and under such penalties as each
House may provide.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish
its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of
two-thirds, expel a member.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and from
time to time publish the same, excepting such parts as may, in their
judgment, require secrecy; and the yeas and nays of the members of
either House on any question, shall, at the desire of one-fifth of those
present, be entered on the journal.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Neither House, during the session of Congress, shall, without
the consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any
place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sec. VI.</span>—1. The Senators and Representatives shall receive a
compensation for their services, to be ascertained by law, and paid out
of the treasury of the United States. They shall, in all cases, except
for treason, felony and breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest
during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses, and in
going to or returning from the same; and for any speech or debate in
either House they shall not be questioned in any other place.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. No Senator or Representative shall, during the time for which
he was elected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of
the United States, which shall have been created, or the emoluments
whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no person
holding any office under the United States, shall be a member of either
House, during his continuance in office.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sec. VII.</span>—1. All bills for raising revenues shall originate in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or concur with
amendments, as on other bills.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives
and the Senate, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the
President of the United States; if he approves, he shall sign it; but
if not, he shall return it, with his objections, to that House in which it
shall have originated, who shall enter the objections at large on their
journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If, after such reconsideration,
two-thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill, it must be sent,
together with the objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise
be reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of that House, it
shall become a law. But in all such cases the votes of both Houses
shall be determined by yeas and nays; and the names of the persons
voting for and against the bill, shall be entered on the journal of each
House respectively. If any bill shall not be returned by the President
within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented
to him, the same shall be a law in like manner as if he had signed it,
unless the Congress, by their adjournment, prevent its return; in which
case it shall not be a law.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Every order, resolution, or vote, to which the concurrence of the
Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a
question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the
United States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved
by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two-thirds
of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the rules and
limitations prescribed in the face of a bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises; to pay

  <h2 class='c004'>FIRST PRONUNCIAMENTO.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The disorganized condition of parties in the United States at the
present time affords a favorable opportunity for a review of the political
situation and for comment on the issues which are likely to come
up for settlement in the Presidential election in 1872. As I happen to
be the most prominent representative of the only unrepresented class
in the republic, and perhaps the most practical exponent of the principles
of equality, I request the favor of being permitted to address the
public through the medium of the <cite>Herald</cite>. While others of my sex devoted
themselves to a crusade against the laws that shackle the women
of the country, I asserted my individual independence; while others
prayed for the good time coming, I worked for it; while others argued
the equality of woman with man, I proved it by successfully engaging
in business; while others sought to show that there was no valid
reason why women should be treated, socially and politically, as
being inferior to man, I boldly entered the arena of politics and
business and exercised the rights I already possessed. I therefore
claim the right to speak for the unenfranchised women of the country,
and believing as I do that the prejudices which still exist in the popular
mind against women in public life will soon disappear, I now announce
myself as candidate for the Presidency.</p>

<p class='c008'>I am quite well aware that in assuming this position I shall evoke
more ridicule than enthusiasm at the outset But this is an epoch
of sudden changes and startling surprises. What may appear absurd
to-day will assume a serious aspect to-morrow. I am content to wait
until my claim for recognition as a candidate shall receive the calm
consideration of the press and the public. The blacks were cattle
in 1860; a negro now sits in Jeff Davis’ seat in the United States
Senate. The sentiment of the country was, even in 1863, against negro
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>suffrage; now the negro’s right to vote is acknowledged by the constitution
of the United States. Let those, therefore, who ridiculed the
negro’s claim to exercise the right to “life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness,” and who lived to see him vote and hold high public office,
ridicule the aspirations of the women of the country for complete
political equality as much as they please. They cannot roll back the
rising tide of reform. The world moves.</p>

<p class='c008'>That great Governmental changes were to follow the enfranchisement
of the negro I have long foreseen. While the curse of
slavery covered the land progress was enchained, but when it was
swept away in the torrent of war, the voice of justice was heard,
and it became evident that the last weak barrier against complete
political and social equality must soon give way. All that has
been said and written hitherto, in support of equality for women has had
its proper effect on the public mind, just as the anti-slavery speeches
before secession were effective; but a candidate and a policy are required
to prove it. Lincoln’s election showed the strength of the feeling
against the peculiar institution; my candidacy for the Presidency
will, I confidently expect, develop the fact that the principles of equal
rights for all have taken deep root. The advocates of political
equality for women have, besides a respectable known strength, a
great undercurrent of unexpressed power, which is only awaiting
a fit opportunity to show itself. By the general and decided test I
propose, we shall be able to understand the woman question aright,
or at least have done much toward presenting the issue involved
in proper shape. I claim to possess the strength and courage to be
the subject of that test, and look forward confidently, to a triumphant
issue of the canvass.</p>

<p class='c008'>The present position of political parties is anomalous. They are
not inspired by any great principles of policy or economy. Political
preachers paw the air; there is no live issue up for discussion. The
only seemingly distinctive feature upon which a complete and well-defined
diversion exists, is on the dead issue of negro equality, and
this is to the political leaders a harp of a thousand strings.</p>

<p class='c008'>The minor questions of the hour do not affect parties as such,
and no well-defined division of sentiment exists. A great national
question is wanted, to prevent a descent into pure sectionalism. That
question exists in the issue, whether woman shall remain sunk below
the right granted to the negro, or be elevated to all the political
rights enjoyed by man. The simple issue whether woman should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>not have this complete political equality with the negro is the only
one to be tried, and none more important is likely to arise before the
Presidential election. But besides the question of equality others of
great magnitude are necessarily included. The platform that is to
succeed in the coming election must enunciate the <i>general</i> principles
of enlightened justice and economy.</p>

<p class='c008'>A complete reform in our system of prison discipline, having
specially in view the welfare of the families of criminals, whose labor
should not be lost to them; the rearrangement of the system and control
of internal improvements; the adoption of some better means for caring
for the helpless and indigent; the establishment of strictly mutual
and reciprocal relations with all foreign Powers who will unite to
better the condition of the productive class, and the adoption of such
principles as shall recognize this class as the true wealth of the
country, and give it a just position beside capital, thus introducing a
practical plan for universal government upon the most enlightened
basis, for the actual, not the imaginary benefit of mankind.</p>

<p class='c008'>These important changes can only be expected to follow a complete
departure from the beaten tracks of political parties and their
machinery; and this, I believe my canvass of 1872 will effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>That the people are sick of the present administration and the principles
it professes to sustain, is a proposition, I think, that does not
require to be argued; but as I have now taken a decided stand against
its continuance for another term of four years, and offered myself as a
candidate for the Presidential succession, a few preliminary observations
on the general management of our home and foreign policy will
not be out of place. The present administration has been a failure from
the beginning; weak, vacillating and deficient in moral courage, it
commands neither the respect nor admiration of foreign Powers nor
receives the active support of its party. The general management of our
foreign and domestic affairs does not seem to have risen to the dignity
of a policy; though it be allowed to have been consistent in its various
parts, it has been destitute of that decision and firmness which characterized
the victorious soldier who is now President.</p>

<p class='c008'>A decided Cuban policy would not only have settled at once
the inevitable destiny of that island, but would also have given
republican sentiment in Spain an impetus, strengthened the South
American republics and exercised a healthy influence in Mexico and
Canada. But instead of this we have to submit to the consequences
of a policy of cowardice. American citizens abroad are murdered by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Spanish cut-throats, our consuls are insulted, and our flag is disgraced.
This is unworthy of the American nation, and the people will hold Grant
accountable. A giant who never shows his strength is neither feared
nor respected. On the important questions of taxation, the tariff and
the public debt, the administration seems to have no settled policy.
Taxation, whether for the support of the Government or the payment of
the debt, should in all cases be general and never special. No special
interest, nor several special interests, should be singled out to sustain
an extra proportion of taxation. And in regard to the tariff the same
principle should be enforced. Whether the public debt be a blessing
or a curse, it exists. Created to save the republic, it must be paid
strictly according to both the spirit and the letter of the law. But
there is no immediate necessity for paying it off. By a proper policy
its payment might be made to extend through a hundred years, for
even beyond that time will the benefits its creation produced be felt
and appreciated. In older countries the pressure of national debt becomes
a heavier charge and a mightier burden every succeeding year,
but with us this is reversed. The development of our magnificent resources
will render the gradual payment of our indebtedness easier
of accomplishment with each decade of time.</p>

<p class='c008'>All other questions, whether of a foreign or domestic nature, stand
illustrated by the Cuban policy of the administration. A bold, firm
and, withal, consistent national policy, if not at all times strictly within
the conservative limits of international law, will always command the
respect and support of the people.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the view of spreading to the people ideas which hitherto
have not been placed before them, and which they may, by reflection,
carefully amplify for their own benefit, I have written several papers on
Governmental questions of importance and will submit them in due
order. For the present the foregoing must suffice. I anticipate criticism;
but however unfavorable the comment this letter may evoke I trust that
my sincerity will not be called in question. I have deliberately and of
my own accord placed myself before the people as a candidate for the
Presidency of the United States, and having the means, courage, energy
and strength necessary for the race, intend to contest it to the close.</p>

<p class='c008'>In national as well as in individual affairs, it is well to occasionally
take an exact account of the situation in which we are; to balance “our
general books,” to see whether the balance is to the “debit or credit”
or “profit and loss,” and to decide from the results obtained whether
satisfactory progress has been made. As nothing more than “a journal”
of such affairs as we shall take into the account has been kept, it will
be our duty to “post” these affairs into a new “ledger” from existing
“journals,” and also to enter up the new balances which we may find
standing to the several accounts.</p>

<p class='c008'>At no time since the close of the Revolutionary War has there
been a time more fitting and inviting for such a work. The whole
world is in a ferment, which was begun by the terrific strife into
which the course of events forced us, and from which we have just
emerged through the reconstruction of an almost demolished Governmental
structure. Not all of the legitimate results of that strife are
even yet externally apparent, either in our own country or in the world
at large. There are various undercurrents, eddies and outcroppings
which have never been taken into any consideration; but when considered,
the destiny of this country, so long foreshadowed, but which
was pretty nearly eclipsed, shines forth more clearly brilliant than ever
before.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whatever may have been the arguments favorable for the continuance
of the institution of slavery, the destruction of it has rendered
them nugatory, and but few of those who once used them could now
be found to favor its resurrection. The atmosphere is cleared of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>cloud it was draped with, under its influence, and the radiant sun of
freedom now shines for all, and the star of hope our night was illumined
by shall now no more be dimmed by the dense fogs that were wont
to arise from its then already decaying carcass. With its destruction
the lives of two great political parties passed away, and left the people
with no distinct lines of demarkation. It is true that there bodies still
exist, but the process of disintegration is rapidly going on, and the
stench of their decay fills the nostrils of all whose senses are rendered
acute by the intensifying power of intuitive perception.</p>

<p class='c008'>Creation is from one point toward one purpose, the extremes of
which course, are beyond the comprehension of human ken. Any fact
in the line of its progress may be considered, and the relations it bears
to contemporaneous facts determined. A fact isolated from all connections
loses its significance. The comparison of a fact with other facts
forms the basis of all relative knowledge, and the further this comparison
is extended, the wider the range of this knowledge becomes: while
an infinite series of facts constitutes the sum total of creation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hence, to obtain a substantially correct knowledge of the present,
the facts of it must not only be considered as facts of the present, but
their relations to, and dependencies upon prior facts, out of which they
arose, must be traced, so that it may be determined why they exist.
It is not sufficient to simply assert that this or that is thus or so. To do so
carries no conviction nor prophetic knowledge of what must be next,
as a necessary sequence. But if a retrospective glance be taken of the
causes that produced it, it is thus demonstrated why it is thus. If the
demonstration is placed with the fact, and their tendencies are examined,
it may be fair to conclude that what they may next lead to, may be in
a measure predicated. The chief value, then, of an intimate knowledge
of the past is, that from it the future may be foreseen, and that the lesson
it teaches may assist in the formation of aids to the natural order
of things.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a tree or plant is desired in a certain place, for a certain purpose,
its growth is promoted by all the means which experience has
demonstrated will assist. All other growths that draw from the same
source for supplies, and thereby diminish its fountain of supplies, are
destroyed; the weeds are uprooted, and if the natural supplies which the
earth and air furnish are not sufficient for its demands, that which is
lacking is supplied. The same line of action should govern in the various
departments of nature, and especially in the higher departments
of mind.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>There is another consideration that should never be lost sight of
when a survey of the situation is to be attempted; and this is, that
while the facts which are to be passed upon bear special relations to
their immediate predecessors and surroundings, that these with them
bear certain definite, general relations to the facts of all past time, and
to those that will be in all future time. The present is a part of the
common order of the universe, extending infinitely backward and forward—a
part of the line of evolvement, neither end of which can be
compassed by human mind; and if we would learn well, we must learn
all there is to learn regarding what we learn.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a definite and unanswerable proposition, then, that every nation
of which we have historic record, was a result of pre-existing
causes, and led to further effects, and that each filled and performed a
part, especially its own, which was a natural and necessary result of the
time and place it existed in. By a careful study of the rise and fall
of each of the great nations that have existed and an analytic comparison
of the elements of strength and decay that were prominent
therein, and of their relations to each other, just deductions as to what
the present will lead to, may be arrived at. If the present is the result
of the past, the future must be the result of the present, and like it be
the experiences of creation in the process of evolution from the infinite
to the infinite.</p>

<p class='c008'>Government, standing forth prominently as the grandest of all
human conceptions and realizations, has in all times been the
representative of civilization, and the principal means of its diffusion.
Bearing this impress of importance, it may be well to examine the real
significance of the term, or to find the relations it sustains to society.
One fact meets us wherever we may search in the past—the fact
of government Though it is one of the universal necessities and accompaniments
of existence, it is extremely doubtful if its composition
is realized to any considerable extent. Government means control—implies
power. No people can create government because they cannot
create power. An existing power may be organized into form by a
people, and this becomes their government. This power is not in the
individuals who exercise it, they are simply its servants. It is not
the people who organize or consent to it; they are simply represented
by it. It is above individuals, and is independent of peoples, though
its channels of operation may be modified by individuals and peoples.
Thus come all governments, while revolutions are the results of the
outworking of principles, through peoples, who are their representatives.
When analyzed, it thus appears that governments are independent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>of peoples, and always exist in some form while peoples come and
pass away.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is problematically true, that China was the first nation
that arrived at a system of government at all removed from brute,
individual force, and historically so, that there always was a westward
tendency to empire. After China, India; then Assyria, Egypt,
Persia, Greece, Rome, general Europe and America. Each one of
these nations, to Rome, was the result of the course of events, begun in
China, to the course of which each succeeding one added its experiences.
The progress of this course of events has encircled the world. It can
go no further westward without crossing the Pacific and beginning
again in China. What is the significance of this fact, or has it no special
indications? It is evident that the old order of nature has completed
a cycle, and that a new order will be commenced, and that, the
new order is to spring from this country, and consequently, that we
are its representatives. This is made doubly plain, when we refer to
the fact that Asiatic tendencies are now eastward, and that John Chinaman
is the new competition our laboring classes have to encounter.</p>

<p class='c008'>It cannot be expected that the new order of events, we, as a
country are inaugurating, will be characterized by the element of the
old, just completed. It had its mission to perform. It accomplished
it, and has passed away. Its fruit is our Government and the civilization
of the present. A new mission begins. Are there any sources
from which its character may be predicated? Though the creation has
completed another cycle of progressive development, the common
course of nature never stops. Therefore the same common order prevails
now, that did when the planes of Iran poured forth its people
westward.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the principal features of natural events has been a tendency
on the part of all great nations to acquire universal dominion. Each
in turn attempted it and failed, because of the imperfectly developed
form of the government they sought to control by. What are the evidences
that all future forms may not fail from similar causes, or specially,
that the form we represent will not fail?</p>

<p class='c008'>The first and most important evidence is, that in its organic principles
the Brotherhood of the Human Race is recognized. All men
are born free and equal, does not mean that all men born in the United
States are free and equal, but that all men everywhere are. This,
then, is the basis idea upon which our Government is built; whether
the structure is yet perfect or not the foundation is, and can never be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>overturned. There can be no higher proposition upon which to build;
therefore additions, tending to perfectability, must be made upon this
foundation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another evidence is, that the world is becoming Americanized:
that is, the world is assimilating to the American idea of freedom and
equality. How and why? The vast populations other countries have
transplanted to our soil are in constant communication with friends
they left behind, who thus catch the spirit of equality and freedom, and
become imbued with the spirit of our institutions, and thus involuntarily
become like us, while still subjects of other powers.</p>

<p class='c008'>All nations contribute to our strength, and by so doing render us
not only peculiarly American in character, but cosmopolitan to the
world. We are not only American, but European, Asiatic and African;
while each of these are becoming American. We are, therefore,
the centre of attraction for the world, and the world involuntarily recognizes
our superior strength by giving up its population to increase it;
while we repay it, not in physical strength, but with progressive and
comprehensive ideas. In accordance with these facts, patent to every
one, it is asserted, that The World is becoming Americanized, and that
this is an evidence that the form of government by which we tend to
universal control is founded on those general principles which give it that
permanency, which insures its continuance until it shall become universal.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the order of civilization is observed the same deduction will be
arrived at The material universe has had its geologic periods The
social has had and will have its periods to correspond. Nature maintains
a regular and consistent order everywhere. It is the degree that
this order is understood, by the general mind, that constitutes the
sociologic periods of the world. The first era of civilization was inaugurated
by the Assyrian and Egyptian empires, more especially the
latter, more than 2000 years B. C.</p>

<p class='c008'>This civilization began to spread in the barbaric world immediately
after the famous conquests of Sesostris, and continued during the
time of the Persian, Grecian and Roman empires, culminating with the
downfall of the latter, and thus completing the order of civilization
made possible by Egypt. Egypt conquered and levied tribute upon
the barbarian. Rome conquered, and the barbarian became the Roman
citizen. The present configuration of Europe rose from the ruins of
Rome, and assumed the form through which a greater variety of power
could operate than in the previous era.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>No part of the world but has felt the mighty modifying influence of
the civilizing power of modern Europe. It has permeated the entire
temperate zone, penetrated the frozen latitudes north and south, and
attacked the Hottentot of Central Africa and the Bushman of Australia.
It organized legislation, perfected and maintained administration and
made it possible for all minds to attain individuality, and for individuals,
as such, to rise by personal merit, even from the lowest strata of society.
By its procreative power a new continent, full of native purity and
vitality, conceived, and a higher degree of life than it represented
burst upon the startled world.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the first era, it was one controlling mind operating for personal
ends and aggrandizement; in the second, it was several, operating
for the same end; in the third, it will be all minds merged in one
channel, to operate for the good of the whole. The first was personal
civilization thrust upon the barbarism of the world compelling it into
servility; the second was sectional civilization exerting its influence,
first upon its immediate subjects, and through them upon others
less advanced; the third shall be general civilization, in which the
utmost parts of the earth can join in one grand and common effort
for mutual advancement, its peoples having risen to the recognition
of the greatest of all human facts—the common brotherhood of
mankind.</p>

<p class='c008'>From these general observations the tendencies in the order of
the universe must be inferred, and if there is any inference possible to
be drawn, which will coincide with the present aspect of affairs, it is,
that upon this country devolves the duty, no less than the privilege, of
presenting the world with a form of administrative government that
shall be possessed of the elements of perfection and duration; and
this brings us down to the consideration, whether this general indication
of the centuries does coincide with the condition in which the
world is to-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Europe contains but four positive determining powers: Russia,
Prussia, France and England, while the remainder of the Eastern Continent
is unrepresented. The Western Continent contains the United
States. France and Prussia have been the contending parties for simple
European supremacy: the former probably also entertaining an
ulterior design upon Africa. The policy of England and Russia is
more comprehensive, and undoubtedly includes the possibility of a
consolidated Continent. Consistent with this view, England is performing
in India what Cæsar did in Gaul; and Russia, in Western
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Asia, what Rome did in “The East.” They comprehend that every
nation is an object upon which change is indelibly stamped, and that
it will remain so until some one of them shall arrive at a perfect system
of government, which shall be the pattern for all government, or
which shall absorb all government. These countries labor under one
insurmountable difficulty. All the effort they expend to carry their policies
abroad detracts just so much from their actual home strength, and
they have no fountain, furnishing supplies to make good their expenditure,
and they thus expand at the expense of vitality.</p>

<p class='c008'>Notwithstanding this great difficulty, Russian supremacy might
be a consistent conclusion, could the fact of the rapid diffusion of
principles antagonistic to monarchy be left out of the consideration;
but considered, as it necessarily must be, the legitimate conclusion is
entirely different. It is too well known what sentiments lie suppressed
in various parts of continental Europe—in Poland, Hungary, Italy,
France, Germany, Spain and England—to ever make it possible that
the common order of advancement should so change as to compel the
general mind from general freedom toward absolute monarchy, as represented
by Russia, or to any monarchy represented by any of the nations
of Europe. The common course of events will not so change,
but it will continue in the direction of general freedom, not only in
Europe but over the entire continent. Considering the progress this
sentiment has already made in connection with events which are transpiring
in Europe, it is not presuming very much to say that it will
ultimately convert Western and Central Europe into great republics,
represented by the Latin and the Teuton.</p>

<p class='c008'>So much for the special situation of Europe proper, as connected
with its local policies. England and Russia have further reaching pretensions,
and, by so having, their policies become intermingled with
American policies.</p>

<p class='c008'>The processes of civilization are soon to receive accelerating powers
in Asia. England, by virtue of her great commercial influence,
has already exerted very considerable modifying effect upon the vast
population of India. China, by its fickle action regarding foreigners
resident there, is claiming the attention of all interested countries, in
such manner as will undoubtedly force these countries to use some
other than moral suasion to compel its people to the common usages of
the civilized world. Thus barbarism invites the elements which ultimately
transform it into general worldly utility.</p>

<p class='c008'>With China, the United States has more intimate connection, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>reason of recent scientific progress, and, with England, will divide the
honor of civilizing Eastern Asia. American influence, however, will
be the preponderant influence, for the Chinese are attracted to this
country, and the genius of our institutions cannot fail to react through
such as come here upon China itself. While this process of evolution
is going on in Eastern Asia, Russia will be effecting the same purposes
in Western Asia, and thus these three nations will in due course of
time reclaim the most densely populated part of the world and add it
to the sum total of civilization.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a very important and highly suggestive inference to be
drawn from the tendency the peoples of Europe have been exhibiting
during the past few years. Italian unity has been accomplished, and
German unity is about to be accomplished. It is not to be supposed
that this process will stop short of further consolidations. Continental
Europe is Latin and Teuton, and Slav, and this process cannot well
cease until these are united under their respective governments. When
this shall have been accomplished, thrones and crowns will have done
their work, and the peoples will be ready to erect the Latinic, the Teutonic,
and the Slavonic Republics, three mighty nations which could
in peace and quiet pursue their respective appointments in the path of
progress, until a necessity should arise for a still wider and more comprehensive
unity, in which, under one head, the three should be united.
They who have studied the general tendencies of governmental evolution
cannot doubt but such a consummation awaits Continental Europe,
nor that Asia is destined to be regenerated as above shadowed forth.</p>

<p class='c008'>If such be the course events must take, what is the lesson to be
gathered by that part of the world’s people who speak the English language?
The location of the countries they inhabit does not so readily
point to unity, but all their interests will compel it. The nations of
the world instinctively seek equality of power, or rather, they seek to
keep pace with each other in acquiring power. In view of the prospective
union of the three dominant races in Continental Europe,
where shall England look for her compensating power, except it be in
a unity of all peoples speaking the English Language?</p>

<p class='c008'>It is true that in this Western Continent there is a new race being
built up, in whose composition all other races are destined to become
blended, and which will inevitably be the dominant and the absorbing
future race of the world. However, in the mean time, England’s only
hope for the retention of an existence, or at least of any general power,
will be to unite its peculiar national characteristics to the younger and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>more rapidly changing peoples of America. There might be reasons
without number adduced in support of the suggested course, while
valid ones against it cannot be found. The power such a nation would
represent would be one that neither nor all of the prospective Continental
European countries could hinder from pursuing its predestined
work in Asia and Africa, to which latter division enterprise is just being
attracted by the discovery of immense diamond countries, which
are first offered as the necessary temptation to draw people to it, who
shall afterward find other riches than precious stones within its virgin
soil, as other than golden wealth has been found in California.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus, in as comprehensive a manner as possible, is presented the
present general situation and its evident tendencies, which bring us to
the special consideration of the present condition of the country, which,
of all countries, is destined to play the most prominent part in the third
order of civilization—the United States of America.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have just arisen mightier than ever from a civil war which
was intended by the world’s conservatism to destroy us, and with a
population of forty millions we step at once into the front ranks of,
and into the lead in, the grand march of progress. Our Government
is a nearer approach to a popular form, and more nearly allied to true
freedom and justice than any other in existence. We have, however,
only to review the causes which led to the civil war to see how far we
still are from a perfect form.</p>

<p class='c008'>This war was either a necessary result of existing causes or else
it was a great national blunder. Many who recognize no order or law
in the progress of civilization, deny both these propositions, and affirm
that the war was produced solely by the personal ambition of party
leaders, representing the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro</span></i> and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">con.</span></i> of the institution of slavery. If
the matter is viewed from the standpoint of the science of society,
each one of these propositions is relatively true, but neither is absolutely
so. The war was the necessary result of the growth of the principles
of freedom within the general mind, in antagonism to special,
local interests, which evidences that it did arise naturally, out of the
existing conditions, while the individuals who were prominent upon
either side may be considered as responsible for precipitating it. Those
who stood by, constituting much the larger proportion of the representative
men of the nation, and observed the growth of the conflict
between the two extremes, without stepping in to control the situation,
place it altogether in the light of a great national blunder or crime.
Had the circumstances been controlled by this large third party, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>first proposition would have been true, and yet the war have been prevented.</p>

<p class='c008'>We are obliged to speak relatively of relative things, and to consider
facts, isolated from the general sum of all facts, and in a special
sense, and in this sense the war was an enormous national blunder, and
should have been averted by a bold grasping and control of the circumstances
on the part of the Government and those whose <i>duty</i> it was to
have known what the result would be. These servants of the people,
to whom was intrusted the welfare of the country, were utterly false
and faithless, and allowed us to be precipitated, entirely unprepared,
into a fratricidal war which cost the common country millions of lives
and billions of treasure.</p>

<p class='c008'>How much better would it have been had the situation been understood
and controlled; had the Government shown itself competent
to meet it; had it raised armies and occupied the disaffected country
and then abolished slavery, which it was finally obliged to do, but
which could have been done previously without the sacrifice of life and
wealth. Such action would have exhibited the highest order of statesmanship
and would have been the admiration of ages.</p>

<p class='c008'>This examination of the causes which led to the war is made to
show, that in our system of government as now administered, there is
no responsibility anywhere, and if we drift into danger and destruction
no one is accountable; and also, that it is the habitual practice,
to evade issues which press for solution, by dodging along with small
expedients, hoping the issues themselves will die out or pass away.
This has been true of us as a government since corruption first began
to find its emissaries among our legislators, and since, it has continually
grown more and more decidedly a feature of its administration,
until to-day we stand a gigantic nation without giving any indication
that we realize our power or that we have any national policy other
than to be quite certain that we do not interfere with any of the nice
arrangements of other nations, or that we do not lend struggling freedom
a sympathetic helping hand, such as we first acquired life by.</p>

<p class='c008'>By whom are our legislative halls filled? Do we find any Jeffersons,
Jacksons, Hamiltons, Bentons, Websters or Clays among them? No!
As a rule, to which, however, there a few most honorable exceptions,
there are all small men with ideas no more comprehensive than the
districts or States they represent, and who make the purposes of
personal gain the mainspring of all their actions. What can such men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>thus employed, know of a great nation’s power; or what her policy
should be?</p>

<p class='c008'>There have been two great political divisions of the people called
Republican and Democratic, the issue between which, grew entirely out
of the slavery question and its sequel, War and Reconstruction. These
issues are all settled. Slavery can never more be made a party issue.
All efforts that have been made to galvanize it into life have proved
futile. The Democratic party leaders have pretty nearly given up the
issue as utterly dead, though many of the rank and file still mouth
“the nigger.” The Republican party has absolutely nothing to make
it hold together except possession of place and power, which in these
times of levying official taxation is no inconsiderable advantage. As
for issues and policies, both parties absolutely lack them. The Democratic
and Republican parties exist to-day in opposition to each other,
simply and solely because they were opposed to each other upon the
issues now dead. No live issues divide them. All of these which are
before the people find advocates and opposers in both ranks, so that in
reality there are no political parties in existence which represent any
question to be solved or settled. Nothing could be more appropriate
in the political musterings and parades of either party than that upon
their banners should be inscribed—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WANTED, A POLICY.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It is evident, if another Presidential canvass passes over, that
some grand issue must come up to give the people inspiration, and
which will be of such character as to <i>divide</i> them, not such as would
<i>unite</i> them unanimously; for to this last condition, it is to be feared,
we have not yet arrived <i>though there may be such things arise as will
command as much unanimity</i> as Washington commanded; but this
could not be, <i>except revolution</i> occurs and it becomes the result of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a young intelligence such as we represent, no old issues can
be made to divide parties. Upon such questions as have heretofore
been made the distinguishing features of political parties, there should
be no misunderstanding. That there is, demonstrates that the principles
of government have not been taught to the people. It teaches
that party leaders have built up theories which lack the support of
science and principle; and in this way all those issues upon which the
permanent vitality of the country depends have been put before the
people, colored and trimmed to suit their prejudices and to shape parties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>into opposition. Were all of these issues taught to the people as
the legitimate deduction of the science of government, and entirely
bereft of partisanship, they would all work together for the obtaining
of more, greater and better conditions and privileges. To bring about
this course for the people is the object of the science of society which
is just beginning to be recognized.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are but three principles by which all questions should be
tested: Freedom, Equality and Justice; and when legislation shall be
brought to the test of these, and entirely abstracted from partisanship,
there will not be very much further legislation to be performed. All
questions now undecided, which still remain before the people, such as
those of finance, commerce, revenue, internal improvements, and international
policy, should have the touchstone of these principles applied,
and they should be decided thereby. It should be asked of them,
What course do you point out which will be consistent with freedom,
which shall not interfere with equality, and which shall be just to
everybody? We venture to assert that, tried by these tests, not a single
line of policy which is now being pursued by the Government will
stand. Surely its financial policy cannot; for what is there in it which
is consistent with the constitutional question of freedom? Surely its
revenue, its tariff system, cannot, for what is there in either which is
not in direct antagonism with equality?—while we may look in vain
for even the skeleton of justice wherever money can find its way.</p>

<p class='c008'>All this is true, and very much more, and it comes of the departure
of legislation and administration from the fundamental propositions
of the Constitution. It is also true that such conditions cannot
last. The people, as a whole, are not entirely unregenerate, though so
many of their self-appointed leaders are. It only remains for the people
to become fully aroused to the depths of corruption to which legislation
and administration have been carried to demand and obtain the
needed redress. This corruption is not confined to Government, but it
has permeated nearly all corporate organizations, many of which are
organized specially to defraud the productive classes of their hard-earned
wealth. The possibility of this being done is because our system
of finance is entirely wrong, and nothing will save the country
from general financial and commercial ruin except complete revolution in
this system. If the ruin comes it will ultimately fall upon the producing
classes. In other words, the producing interests of the country cannot
sustain the inflation of prices which has been brought about by speculation,
in alliance with fraud, which are the ruling spirits of the day.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>It may be said that such radical changes as will depose the powers
which rule us, and inaugurate the reign of principles, which will secure
freedom, equality and justice to every power, cannot yet be introduced.
We aver that they can; and further, we aver that unless it is done,
revolution such as has never yet been known will inaugurate them for
us. The whole substrata of society is seething and foaming with pent-up
endurance of injustice and wrong, and unless those abuses which
have produced this condition are remedied at once, the existence of the
Government cannot be counted upon. And it is criminal to seek to
ignore this fact. We must not “lie supinely upon our backs while the
enemy binds us hand and foot,” and delivers us to destruction.</p>

<p class='c008'>In view, then, of our destiny as a nation, and in view of the position
which the order of events seems to have assigned us, we are called
upon to put our Government in perfect order before the constructive
part of the work of the third part of the order of civilization is to be
begun. We must be perfect within ourselves before we can expect to
become the pattern for others, or expect that others will gravitate to
us. <span class='sc'>The Review of the General Situation</span>, then, results in the
finding that the process of diffusive government has culminated, and
that the process of a continuously constructive and concentrating government
has already been begun, in which our Government, as the
most progressive representative of the principles upon which a perfect
government can alone exist, is assigned the leading position, and that
we, recognizing this assignment, should proceed to assume the responsibilities
and the duties which legitimately flow from it; and they
are great in the same degree that our destiny is great.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was under the realization of what our destiny should be that the
Pronunciamento of April 2, 1870, in the New York <cite>Herald</cite>, was made;
and now, having offered this general review, my Second Pronunciamento,
which is supplementary to and the completing of the first, is
laid before the people. It is believed that the policy and principles
underlying it, proclaimed therein, will be the final departure necessary
to be made, as the point from which progress will be continued,
until the grand realization of the prophecies of all ages is fulfilled, when
all nations, kindred and tongues shall be united in one harmonious
family, they having risen into the full knowledge of the truth, that
whether we be Christian or Pagan, Greek or Roman, Atheist or Spiritualist,
we are all the children of one common Father, God, whom we
shall ever worship as the Creator, Ruler and Final Destiny of the Universe.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c004'>SECOND PRONUNCIAMENTO.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c010'>CONSTITUTIONAL EQUALITY THE LOGICAL RESULT OF THE XIV. AND XV.

<p class='c007'>The time has now arrived when it becomes proper to present the
final and unanswerable proposition, which cannot by any possibility be
controverted, that the several States which, until recently, assumed and
exercised the right of defining which of its citizens should exercise the
right to vote, have by their own voluntary act not only forever repealed
all such prohibitory laws, but also have forever barred their re-enactment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of this I have been fully aware since the proclamation by the President
that the XV. Amendment had become a part of the Organic Law
of the country.</p>

<p class='c008'>To bring the whole matter properly before the public I published
an address on the 2d of April last, in which I announced myself a candidate
for the Presidency in 1872, and thus asserted the right of woman
to occupy the highest office in the gift of the people.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>After that address had had its legitimate effect in arousing the press
of the country to the realization that women are a constituent part of
the body politic, and to a discussion in a much more general way than
had ever been before, I published my second address to the people, announcing
that the XVI. Amendment was a dead letter, and that the Constitution
fully recognized the equality of all citizens.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this address the general bearings of the Constitution were examined,
and from the blending of its various parts the conclusion was arrived
at that no State should deny the right to vote to any citizen.</p>

<p class='c008'>I now take the final step, and show that the States themselves, by
their legislative enactments, have removed the only obstacle which until
then had prevented women from voting, and have forever debarred
themselves from receding to their former position. It is as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Suffrage</span>, or the right to vote, is declared by the XV. Article
of Amendments to the Constitution to be a <span class='sc'>Right</span>, not a privilege, of
citizens of the United States.</p>

<p class='c008'>A right of a citizen is inherent in the individual, of which he cannot
be deprived by any law of any State.</p>

<p class='c008'>A privilege may be conferred upon the citizen of the State, and by
it may be taken away. This distinction is made to show that <i>to vote is
not a privilege</i> conferred by a State upon its citizens, but a <span class='sc'>Constitutional
Right</span> of every citizen of the United States, of which they cannot
be deprived. The language of the Constitution is most singularly
emphatic upon this point. It is as follows:</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ARTICLE XV.</h3>

<p class='c011'>1. <i>The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied
or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race,
color, or previous condition of servitude.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It is thus forever proclaimed, in unmistakable terms, that <i>to vote
is a right</i> of citizens of the United States.</p>

<p class='c008'>Were it an immunity, or even were it a privilege, to vote, those
who possess it could not be deprived of it by any State, for the State
is bound to protect every citizen within its jurisdiction in the exercise
thereof. It being declared by the XV. Amendment that citizens
of the United States have the right to vote, the next step to determine
is, Who are citizens? This is also definitely, though for the first
time, determined by Article XIV. of Amendments to the Constitution
as follows:</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>ARTICLE XIV.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject
to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and
of the State wherein they reside. <i>No State shall make or enforce any
law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
United States.</i> Nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or
property without due process of law, <i>nor deny to any person</i> within its
jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next point of inquiry is, How is it that the State laws which
formerly did proscribe women and exclude them from the exercise of
suffrage, no longer <i>do</i> so? Simply and effectively by this fact, that, by
the adoption of the XV. Article of Amendments to the Constitution,
the States established, as the “<span class='fss'>SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND</span>,” the fact
that no person born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the
jurisdiction thereof shall be denied or abridged by the United
States, or by any State, of the <span class='fss'>RIGHT TO VOTE</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Women are citizens of the United States; and the States themselves,
by their own voluntary act, have established the fact of their citizenship,
and confirmed their right to vote, which, by such action, has become the
supreme law of the land, which supersedes, annuls and abrogates all
previous State laws inconsistent therewith or contravening the same.
The XV. Article of Amendments to the Constitution is as much a part
of it as any originally adopted; for Art VI., ¶ 2, says:</p>

<p class='c013'>This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be
made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be
made under the authority of the United States, <i>shall be</i> <span class='fss'>THE SUPREME</span>
<i>law of</i> <span class='fss'>THE LAND</span>; and the <i>judges in</i> <span class='fss'>EVERY</span> <i>State shall</i> <span class='fss'>BE BOUND
THEREBY</span>; anything in <i>the Constitution or laws</i> <span class='fss'>OF ANY</span> <i>State</i> <span class='fss'>TO THE
CONTRARY NOTWITHSTANDING</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The XV. Amendment was adopted by the several States as a legislative
enactment by their Legislatures, under Art V., which provides:</p>

<p class='c008'>The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it
necessary, <i>shall propose amendments to this Constitution</i>; or, on the application
of the Legislatures of two-thirds of the several States, shall
call a convention for proposing amendments, <i>which</i>, in either case, <i>shall
be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution</i>, when
<i>ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths thereof</i> as the one or the other
mode of ratification may be proposed by Congress, provided that no amendment
which may be made prior to the year one thousand eight
hundred and eight, shall, in any manner, affect the first and fourth
clauses in the ninth section of the first article; <span class='fss'>AND THAT NO
STATE, WITHOUT ITS CONSENT, SHALL BE DEPRIVED OF ITS EQUAL
SUFFRAGE IN THE SENATE</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Since, therefore, all citizens have the <span class='fss'>RIGHT TO VOTE</span> under this act
or participation by the Legislatures of the several States, all State Laws
which abridge the right are inoperative, null and void, and the exclusion
of women who are citizens from the right to vote, was repealed
and must stand repealed until the Legislatures of the several States
shall again pass an act positively excluding her. If we again examine
Art XV. we shall see that this right shall not be denied or abridged by
the United States or any State on account of <span class='fss'>RACE</span>, <span class='fss'>COLOR</span>, or <span class='fss'>PREVIOUS
CONDITION OF SERVITUDE</span>; it is left to be inferred that it might be on
account of <span class='fss'>SEX</span>, but this denial has not yet been attempted, nor could it be
accomplished if it were, for here the XIV. Amendment again comes to
our relief saying, “That no State shall make or enforce any law which
shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United
States.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, the Constitution is assuredly a contract between States and
citizens, and Sec. 10, Art I., provides that no State shall pass any law
impairing contracts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Art I., Sec. 4,¶ I, provides that:</p>

<p class='c013'>“The times, places and <i>manner of holding elections</i> for senators and
representatives shall be prescribed in each State, by the Legislature
thereof; but the <i>Congress may, at any time, by law, make or alter such
regulations</i>, except as to the places of choosing senators,” while the judiciary
of the United States has acquired complete jurisdiction over this
matter by the authority of Art III., Sec. 2,¶ 1, which provides that:
“<i>The judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under
this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which
shall be made, under their authority</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And for all these reasons, the State Legislatures having, by the
adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment, abrogated all previously existing,
conflicting laws on the subject of suffrage, are now forever
precluded by the Fourteenth Amendment from re-establishing any restriction
to apply to women, whom the authorities of the United States,
in their support of the Constitution, are in duty bound to protect in
their right to vote.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now what was the fruit of the late war, which threw the entire
nation into such convulsive throes, unless it is found in the Fourteenth
and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution, namely: that grand
change in the fundamental laws which declares <i>who</i> are citizens and
what are their <i>rights</i>, <i>privileges</i> and immunities, which cannot be
abridged? Will any one pretend that these great enactments can be
understood to mean less than the language thereof plainly conveys?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Or will any one claim that the old, absurd State laws, which were sunk
in oblivion by the adoption of these amendments to the Constitution,
are still in force? Who will <i>dare</i> to say, in the face of these plainly
worded amendments, which have such an unmistakable meaning, that
the women of America shall not enjoy their emancipation as well as
the black slave?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Women have the right to vote!</span> It is the duty of the Government
to see that they are not denied the right to exercise it, and, to secure
the necessary action of Congress in the premises, I did, on the 21st
day of December, 1870, memorialize Congress as recorded in the Congressional
<cite>Globe</cite>, December 22, 1870.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Senate:</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Harris presented the memorial of Victoria C. Woodhull, praying
for the passage of such laws as may be necessary and proper for carrying
into execution the right vested by the Constitution in the citizens of
the United States to vote without regard to sex; which was referred to
the Committee on the Judiciary and ordered to be printed.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the House:</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Julian—I ask unanimous consent to present at this time and
have printed in the <cite>Globe</cite> the memorial of Victoria C. Woodhull, claiming
the right of suffrage under the XIV. and XV. Articles of Amendments
to the Constitution of the United States, and asking for the enactment
of the necessary and appropriate legislation to guarantee the exercise
of that right to the women of the United States. I also ask that
the petition be referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.</p>

<p class='c008'>No objection was made, and it was ordered accordingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The petition is as follows:</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE MEMORIAL OF VICTORIA C. WOODHULL,</h3>

<p class='c014'><i>To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States in Congress assembled, respectfully showeth</i>:</p>

<p class='c008'>That she was born in the State of Ohio, and is above the age of
twenty-one years; that she has resided in the State of New York during
the past three years; that she is still a resident thereof, and that she is
a citizen of the United States, as declared by the XIV. Article of
Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</p>

<p class='c008'>That since the adoption of the XV. Article of Amendments to the
Constitution, neither the State of New York nor any other State, nor
any Territory, has passed any law to abridge the right of any citizen of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40A'>40A</span>the United States to vote, as established by said article, neither on account
of sex or otherwise:</p>

<p class='c008'>That, nevertheless, the right to vote is denied to women citizens of
the United States by the operation of Election Laws in the several
States and Territories, which laws were enacted prior to the adoption of
the said XV. Article, and which are inconsistent with the Constitution
as amended, and, therefore, are void and of no effect; but which, being
still enforced by the said States and Territories, render the Constitution
inoperative as regards the right of women citizens to vote:</p>

<p class='c008'>And whereas, Article VI., Section 2, declares “That this Constitution,
and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance
thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the
authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land;
and all judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the
Constitution and laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding:”
And whereas, no distinction between citizens is made in the Constitution
of the United States on account of sex; but the XV. Article of
Amendments to it provides that “No State shall make or enforce any
law which shall abridge the privileges and immunities of citizens of the
United States, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the laws:”</p>

<p class='c008'>And whereas, Congress has power to make laws which shall be necessary
and proper for carrying into execution all powers vested by the
Constitution in the Government of the United States; and to make or
alter all regulations in relation to holding elections for senators
or representatives, and especially to enforce, by appropriate legislation,
the provisions of the said XIV. Article:</p>

<p class='c008'>And whereas, the continuance of the enforcement of said local
election laws, denying and abridging the Right of Citizens to Vote on
account of sex, is a grievance to your memorialist and to various other
persons, citizens of the United States, being women,—</p>

<p class='c008'>Therefore, your memorialist would most respectfully petition your
Honorable Bodies to make such laws as in the wisdom of Congress shall
be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the right vested by
the Constitution in the citizens of the United States to vote, without regard
to sex.</p>

<p class='c008'>And your memorialist will ever pray.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40B'>40B</span>This memorial having been referred to the Judiciary Committee, I
then prepared and submitted the following legal deductions in support
thereof:</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CONSTITUTIONAL EQUALITY.</h3>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>To the Hon. the Judiciary Committees of the Senate and
the House of Representatives of the Congress of the
United States</span>:</p>

<p class='c008'>The undersigned, <span class='sc'>Victoria C. Woodhull</span>, having most respectfully
memorialized Congress for the passage of such laws as in its wisdom
shall seem necessary and proper to carry into effect the rights
vested by the Constitution of the United States in the citizens to vote,
without regard to sex, begs leave to submit to your honorable body the
following in favor of her prayer in said Memorial which has been
referred to your Committee:</p>

<p class='c008'>The public law of the world is founded upon the conceded fact
that sovereignty cannot be forfeited or renounced. The sovereign
power of this country is perpetual in the politically-organized people of
the United States, and can neither be relinquished nor abandoned by
any portion of them. The people in this Republic who confer sovereignty
are its citizens: in a monarchy the people are the subjects of
sovereignty. All citizens of a republic by rightful act or implication
confer sovereign power. All people of a monarchy are subjects who
exist under its supreme shield and enjoy its immunities.</p>

<p class='c008'>The subject of a monarch takes municipal immunities from the
sovereign as a gracious favor; but the woman citizen of this country has
the inalienable “sovereign” right of self-government in <i>her own proper
person</i>. Those who look upon woman’s status by the dim light of the
common law, which unfolded itself under the feudal and military institutions
that establish right upon physical power, cannot find any analogy
in the status of the woman citizen of this country, <i>where the broad
sunshine of our Constitution has enfranchised all</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>As sovereignty cannot be forfeited, relinquished or abandoned,
those from whom it flows—the citizens—are equal in conferring the
power, and should be equal in the enjoyment of its benefits and in the
exercise of its rights and privileges.</p>

<p class='c008'>One portion of citizens have no power to deprive another portion of
rights and privileges such as are possessed and exercised by themselves.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40C'>40C</span>The male citizen has no more right to deprive the female citizen
of the free, public, political expression of opinion than the female
citizen has to deprive the male citizen thereof.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sovereign will of the people is expressed in our written Constitution,
which is the supreme law of the land. The Constitution
makes no distinction of sex. The Constitution defines a woman born
or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction
thereof, to be a citizen. It recognizes the right of citizens to vote. It
declares that the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not
be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account
of “race, color or previous condition of servitude.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Women, white and black, belong to races; although to different
races. A race of people comprises all the people, male and female.
The right to vote cannot be denied on account of race. All people
included in the term race have the right to vote, unless otherwise
prohibited.</p>

<p class='c008'>Women of all races are white, black or some intermediate color.
Color comprises all people, of all races and both sexes. The right to
vote cannot be denied on account of color. All people included in the
term color have the right to vote unless otherwise prohibited.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the right to vote sex has nothing to do. Race and color
include all people of both sexes. All people of both sexes have the
right to vote, unless prohibited by special limiting terms less comprehensive
than race or color. No such limiting terms exist in the Constitution.</p>

<p class='c008'>Women, white and black, have from time immemorial groaned under
what is properly termed in the Constitution “previous condition of
servitude.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Women are the equals of men before the law, and are equal in all
their rights as citizens.</p>

<p class='c008'>Women are debarred from voting in some parts of the United
States, although they are allowed to exercise that right elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c008'>Women were formerly permitted to vote in places where they are
now debarred therefrom.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Naturalization Laws of the United States expressly provide
for the naturalization of women.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the right to vote has only lately been distinctly declared by
the Constitution to be inalienable, under three distinct conditions—in
all of which woman is distinctly embraced.</p>

<p class='c008'>The citizen who is taxed should also have a voice in the subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40D'>40D</span>matter of taxation. “No taxation without representation” is a right
which was fundamentally established at the very birth of our country’s
independence; and by what ethics does any free government impose
taxes on women without giving them a voice upon the subject or a
participation in the public declaration as to how and by whom these
taxes shall be applied for common public use?</p>

<p class='c008'>Women are free to own and to control property, separate and
apart from males, and they are held responsible in their own proper
persons, in every particular, as well as men, in and out of court.</p>

<p class='c008'>Women have the same inalienable right to life, liberty and the
<i>pursuit of</i> happiness that men have. Why have they not this right
politically, as well as men?</p>

<p class='c008'>Women constitute a majority of the people of this country—they
hold vast portions of the nation’s wealth and pay a proportionate share
of the taxes. They are intrusted with the most holy duties and the
most vital responsibilities of society; they bear, rear and educate men;
they train and mould their characters; they inspire the noblest impulses
in men; they often hold the accumulated fortunes of a man’s
life for the safety of the family and as guardians of the infants, and
yet they are debarred from uttering any opinion, by public vote, as to
the management by public servants of these interests; they are the
secret counsellors, the best advisers, the most devoted aids in the most
trying periods of men’s lives, and yet men shrink from trusting them
in the common questions of ordinary politics. Men trust women in
the market, in the shop, on the highway and the railroad, and in all
other public places and assemblies, but when they propose to carry a
slip of paper with a name upon it to the polls, they fear them. Nevertheless,
as citizens women have the right to vote; they are part and
parcel of that great element in which the sovereign power of the land
had birth: and it is by usurpation only that men debar them from
their right to vote. The American nation, in its march onward and
upward, cannot publicly choke the intellectual and political activity
of half its citizens by narrow statutes. The will of the entire people
is the true basis of republican government, and a free expression of
that will by the public vote of all citizens, without distinctions of
race, color, occupation or sex, is the only means by which that will can
be ascertained. As the world has advanced in civilization and culture;
as mind has risen in its dominion over matter; as the principle
of justice and moral right has gained sway, and merely physically organized
power has yielded thereto; as the might of right has supplanted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40E'>40E</span>the right of might, so have the rights of women become more
fully recognized, and that recognition is the result of the development
of the minds of men, which through the ages she has polished, and
thereby heightened the lustre of civilization.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was reserved for our great country to recognize by constitutional
enactment that political equality of all citizens which religion, affection,
and common sense should have long since accorded; it was reserved
for America to sweep away the mist of prejudice and ignorance, and
that chivalric condescension of a darker age, for in the language of
Holy Writ, “The night is far spent, the day is at hand, let us therefore
cast off the work of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.
Let us walk honestly as in the day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be argued against the proposition that there still remains
upon the statute books of some States the word “male” to an exclusion,
but as the Constitution in its paramount character can only be
read by the light of the established principle, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ita lex Scripta est</span></i>; and as
the subject of sex is not mentioned and the Constitution is not limited
either in terms or by necessary implication in the general rights of citizens
to vote, this right cannot be limited on account of anything in the
spirit of inferior or previous enactments upon a subject which is
not mentioned in the supreme law. A different construction would
destroy a vested right in a portion of the citizens, and this no legislature
has a right to do without compensation, and nothing can compensate a
citizen for the loss of his or her suffrage—its value is equal to the value
of life. Neither can it be presumed that women are to be kept from the
polls as a mere police regulation: it is to be hoped, at least, that police
regulations in their case need not be very active. The effect of the
amendments to the Constitution must be to annul the power over this
subject in the States whether past, present or future, which is contrary
to the amendments. The amendments would even arrest the action of
the Supreme Court in cases pending before it prior to their adoption,
and operate as an absolute prohibition to the exercise of any other jurisdiction
than merely to dismiss the suit.</p>

<p class='c008'>3 Dall., 382; 6 Wheaton, 405; 9 Id., 868; 3d Circ., Pa., 1832.</p>

<p class='c008'>And if the restrictions contained in the Constitution as to color,
race or servitude, were designed to limit the State governments in reference
to their own citizens, and were intended to operate also as restrictions
on the Federal power, and to prevent interference with the rights
of the State and its citizens, how then can the State restrict citizens of
the United States in the exercise of rights not mentioned in any restrictive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40F'>40F</span>clause in reference to actions on the part of those citizens having
reference solely to the necessary functions of the General Government,
such as the election of representatives and senators to Congress, whose
election the Constitution expressly gives Congress the power to regulate?</p>

<p class='c008'>S. C., 1847: Fox vs. Ohio, 5 Howard, 410.</p>

<p class='c008'>Your memorialist complains of the existence of State Laws, and
prays Congress, by appropriate legislation, to declare them, as they are,
annulled, and to give vitality to the Constitution under its power
to make and alter the regulations of the States contravening the same.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be urged in opposition that the Courts have power, and
should declare upon this subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Supreme Court has the power, and it would be its duty so to
declare the law; but the Court will not do so unless a determination of
such point as shall arise make it necessary to the determination of a
controversy, and hence a case must be presented in which there can be
no rational doubt. All this would subject the aggrieved parties to much
dilatory, expensive and needless litigation, which your memorialist
prays your Honorable Body to dispense with by appropriate legislation,
as there can be no purpose in special arguments “ad inconvenienti,”
enlarging or contracting the import of the language of the Constitution.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Therefore</i>, Believing firmly in the right of citizens to freely approach
those in whose hands their destiny is placed, under the Providence
of God, your memorialist has frankly, but humbly, appealed to
you, and prays that the wisdom of Congress may be moved to action in
this matter for the benefit and the increased happiness of our beloved
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The issue upon the question of female suffrage being thus definitely
and clearly set forth, and its rights inalienably vested in woman, a
brighter future dawns upon the country. When Congress shall have
moved in the matter, and thus secured to woman the free exercise of
these newly-defined rights, she can unite in purifying the elements of
political strife—in restoring the Government to pristine integrity,
strength and vigor. To do this, many reforms become of absolute necessity.
Prominent among these are—</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40G'>40G</span>A reform in representation by which all Legislative Bodies and
the Presidential Electoral College shall be so elected that minorities as
well as majorities shall have direct representation.</p>

<p class='c008'>A complete reform in Executive and Departmental conduct, by
which the President and the Secretaries of the United States, and the
Governors and State Officers shall be forced to recognize that they are
the servants of the people, appointed to attend to the business of the
people, and not for the purpose of perpetuating their official positions,
or of securing the plunder of public trusts for the enrichment of their
political adherents and supporters.</p>

<p class='c008'>A reform in the tenure of office, by which the Presidency shall be
limited to one term, with a retiring life pension, and a permanent seat in
the Federal Senate, where his Presidential experience may become serviceable
to the nation, and on the dignity and life emolument of Presidential
Senator he shall be placed above all other political position, and
be excluded from all professional pursuits.</p>

<p class='c008'>A radical reform in our Civil Service, by which the Government,
in its executive capacity, shall at all times secure faithful and efficient
officers, and the people trustworthy servants, whose appointment shall
be entirely removed from, and be made independent of, the influence
and control of the legislative branch of the Government, and who shall
be removed for “cause” only, and who shall be held strictly to frequent
public accounting to superiors for all their official transactions, which
shall forever dispose of the corrupt practices induced by the allurements
of the motto of present political parties, that “to the victor
belong the spoils,” which is a remnant of arbitrarily assumed authority,
unworthy of a government emanating from the whole people.</p>

<p class='c008'>A reform in our systems of finance, by which the arbitrary standard
of ancient and feudal despotisms shall be removed; by which the
true source of wealth shall become the basis and the security of a national
currency, which shall be made convertible into a National Bond
bearing such an interest, while in the hands of the people, as shall secure
an equilibrium between the demands of all the varieties of exchanges
and the supply of money to effect them with, the Bond being
also convertible at pleasure into money again, by which system of adjustment,
“plethora” equally with “tightness” shall be banished from
the financial centres of our country; and which, in its practical workings,
shall secure such pecuniary equality between the employing and
the laboring classes as will forever make poverty and its long list of
consequent ills impossible in our country; and which shall suggest the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40H'>40H</span>solution of those schemes which are being discussed for “funding the
public debt” at a lower rate of interest.</p>

<p class='c008'>A complete reform in our system of Internal improvements, which
connect and bind together the several States in commercial unity, to the
end that they shall be conducted so as to administer to the best interests
of the whole people, for whose benefit they were first permitted, and are
now protected; by which the General Government, in the use of its
postal powers, and in the exercise of its duties in regulating commerce
between the States, shall secure the transportation of passengers, merchandise
and the mails, from one extremity of the country to the opposite,
and throughout its whole area, at the actual cost of maintaining
such improvements, plus legitimate interest upon their original cost of
construction, thus converting them into public benefits, instead of their
remaining, as now, hereditary taxes upon the industries of the country,
by which, if continued, a few favored individuals are likely to become
the actual rulers of the country.</p>

<p class='c008'>A complete reform in commercial and navigation laws, by which
American built or purchased ships and American seamen shall be
practically protected by the admission of all that is required for construction
of the first, or the use and maintenance of either, free in bond
or on board.</p>

<p class='c008'>A reform in the relations of the employer and employed, by
which shall be secured the practice of the great natural law, of one-third
of time to labor, one-third to recreation and one-third to rest, that
by this, intellectual improvement and physical development may go on
to that perfection which the Almighty Creator designed.</p>

<p class='c008'>A reform in the principles of protection and revenue, by which the
largest home and foreign demand shall be created and sustained for products
of American industry of every kind; by which this industry shall
be freed from the ruinous effects consequent upon frequent changes in
these systems; by which shall be secured that constant employment to
workingmen and workingwomen throughout the country which will
maintain them upon an equality in all kinds and classes of industry; by
which a continuous prosperity—which, if not so marked by rapid accumulation,
shall possess the merit of permanency—will be secured to all,
which in due time will reduce the cost of all products to a minimum
value; by which the laboring poor shall be relieved of the onerous tax,
now indirectly imposed upon them by government; by which the
burden of governmental support shall be placed where it properly
belongs, and by which an unlimited national wealth will gradually accumulate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40I'>40I</span>the ratio of taxation upon which will become so insignificant
in amount as to be no burden to the people.</p>

<p class='c008'>A reform by which the power of legislative bodies to levy taxes
shall be limited to the actual necessities of the legitimate functions of
government in its protection of the rights of persons, property and
nationality; and by which they shall be deprived of the power to
exempt any property from taxation; or to make any distinctions directly
or indirectly among citizens in taxation for the support of government;
or to give or loan the public property or credit to individuals
or corporations to promote any enterprise whatever.</p>

<p class='c008'>A reform in the system of criminal jurisprudence, by which the
death penalty shall no longer be inflicted—by which the hardened criminal
shall have no human chance of being let loose to harass society
until the term of the sentence, whatever that may be, shall have expired,
and by which, during that term, the entire prison employment
shall be for—and the product thereof be faithfully paid over to—the
support of the criminal’s family; and by which our so-called prisons
shall be virtually transformed into vast reformatory workshops, from
which the unfortunate may emerge to be useful members of society, instead
of the alienated citizens they now are.</p>

<p class='c008'>The institution of such supervisory control and surveillance over
the now low orders of society as shall compel them to industry, and
provide for the helpless, and thus banish those institutions of pauperism
and beggary which are fastening upon the vitals of society, and are
so prolific of crime and suffering in certain communities.</p>

<p class='c008'>The organization of a general system of national education, which
shall positively secure to every child of the country such an education
in the arts, sciences and general knowledge as will render them profitable
and useful members of society, and the entire proceeds of the public
domain should be religiously devoted to this end.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such change in our general foreign policy as shall plainly indicate
that we realize and appreciate the important position which has been assigned
us as a nation by the common order of civilization; which shall
indicate our supreme faith in that form of government which emanates
from, and is supported by, the whole people, and that such government
must eventually be uniform throughout the world; which shall also
have in view the establishment of a Grand International Tribunal, to
which all disputes of peoples and nations shall be referred for final
arbitration and settlement, without appeal to arms; said Tribunal
maintaining only such an International army and navy as would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40J'>40J</span>necessary to enforce its decrees, and thus secure the return of the
15,000,000 of men who now compose the standing armies of the world,
to industrial and productive pursuits.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus in the best sense do I claim to be the friend and exponent of
the most complete equality to which humanity can attain; of the broadest
individual freedom compatible with the public good, and that supreme
justice which shall know no distinction among citizens upon any
ground whatever, in the administration and the execution of the laws;
and also, to be a faithful worker in the cause of human advancement;
and especially to be the co-laborer with those who strive to better the
condition of the poor and friendless; to secure to the great mass of
working people the just reward of their toil,—I claim from these, and
from all others in the social scale, that support in the bold political course
I have taken, which shall give me the strength and the position to carry
out these needed reforms, which shall secure to them, in return, the
blessings which the Creator designed the human race should enjoy.</p>

<p class='c008'>If I obtain this support, woman’s strength and woman’s will, with
God’s support, if He vouchsafe it, shall open to them, and to this country,
a new career of greatness in the race of nations, which can only be
secured by that fearless course of truth from which the nations of the
earth, under despotic male governments, have so far departed.</p>

    <div class='c015'>VICTORIA C. WOODHULL ON THE “TENDENCIES OF GOVERNMENT.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>GOD IN CREATION, IN HISTORY, AND IN GOVERNMENT—A PHILOSOPHICAL PREFACE TO A PHILOSOPHICAL DISCOURSE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>[The head of the firm of Woodhull, Claflin &amp; Co., Commodore
Vanderbilt’s financial <i>proteges</i>—the famous brokers of Broad street—has
undertaken the difficult task of correcting popular errors in the
science of government, and has prepared a paper on the subject, which,
as the lady expects to be too busy to deliver for some time to come,
we publish it <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in extenso</span></i>. Whether her conclusions will agree with
her premises or not, the document will be found exceedingly interesting,
as showing the quality of the female mind against which the
money changers of Wall street will have to contend in business:]</p>

<p class='c008'>As far back into the past as dim historic lights enable us to see,
and still much farther, even behind the appearance of man upon the
face of this planet, the existence of government can be plainly traced.
Wherever two or more of any species of animals—not to descend lower
and including man—are or have been, something simulating to what
is in our day denominated government exists or existed; and, whether
it is or was over a greater or less community, it is or was possessed of
certain characterizing elements, from and by which a clear insight into
the composition of the community can be obtained by those who will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>analyze the elements somewhat philosophically; that is to say governments
are truthful reflections of the governed when considered as a
whole, and all changes or modifications that occur therein, result from
growth of the governed.</p>

<p class='c008'>No just nor advantageous deductions from any subject or fact
which is worthy of a position in the world’s history, and which is capable
of permanently maintaining such a position, can be arrived at,
except through a complete philosophical analysis of all the elements
entering into its composition. All facts as well as all chemical compounds
are made up of elementary principles brought into intimate
productive relations by some general power, operating by some general
law of combination. By such an analysis the composition of such
subjects and facts as are analyzed are not only determined, but the relations
which they sustain to all other subjects and facts are also demonstrated,
and thus a general law of relativity is found which makes
the whole round of creation one in purpose and effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not proposed in the present article to prosecute an exhaustive
analysis of government as it is or as it has been, but rather to observe
the chain of progression which has been evolved, and to endeavor
to determine whether, link by link, it does not form one harmonious
whole, from the present aspect of which its culmination may be caught
sight of; and whether that culmination will not be found a complete
circle, containing within its immense area all that has conspired and
assisted in its completion, and which will be entitled to positions in such
a community of interests by virtue of having thus conspired and assisted
in its formation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Neither is it proposed to extend the limits of this inquiry beyond the
consideration of human government, except in so far as analogies may be
sought to enforce the application of general laws and to assist by such
application in the solution of such questions as may not be entirely apparent
from the evidences contained specifically within the said limits.
Philosophically considered, however, the objects sought could as well
be obtained from any other department of government; for, while a
general law underlies all forms and systems of human government and
controls all its modifications, the self-same law underlies and controls
all other forms and systems of government, from which human government
sprung and upon which it rests as a primary basis.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is believed that there is sufficient mental development and comprehension
contained in the philosophic minds of this latter part of
the nineteenth century to gather into form the evidence that has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>and is being presented, in the evolution and dissolution of government,
and grasp its signification, so that in its application to existing things,
permanent instead of politic modifications in governmental affairs may
be inaugurated. Governed by any other than such a broad standard,
changes and modifications in present systems and forms are made
simply to meet the exigencies of the times, and with no view to place
government upon a basis which should never need modification, and
which should meet all exigencies of all times. The reasons why such
government has not hitherto been inaugurated or attempted, are, because
in no country has the general mind as yet become sufficiently
broad and comprehensive to discover that great general laws underlie
the universe and govern all its manifestations, applying to each and
every department thereof with perfect uniformity. It is not my province
to discuss what these great general laws and principles are. I assume
that they do exist, and it is my office to predicate what the future
of government must be when it shall have its basis in such laws and
principles, and to judge whether what has been, and what is, may be
considered as gradual approaches from the most simple and homogeneous
forms in which the interest of all were very indefinite, either individually
or collectively, toward that wherein the interests of all, while
becoming more distinct individually, shall be merged in the general interests
of the whole and become identical therewith.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Maine says, in his “Ancient Law,” that “society in ancient
times was not what it is assumed to be at present—a collection of individuals.
In fact, and in view of the men that composed it, it was
an aggregation of families. The contrast may be best and most forcibly
expressed by saying that the unit of an ancient society was the
family; of a modern society, the individual.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In speaking of ancient society, Mr. Fiske says: “Family government
excluded not only individual independence but also State supremacy;
and that vestiges of a time when there were no aggregates
of men more extensive than the family may be found in every
part of the world, when social organization was but one step removed
from absolute and ferocious anarchy;” and this he defines as a social
aggregate of the first order; the coalescence of families into civic communities
an aggregate of the second order; the coalescence of civic
and tribual communities into the nation an aggregate of the third
order. The coalescence of nations would then describe an aggregate
of the fourth order. Under these four orders all the forms of government
which can ever exist in the world must be classified.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>As low a form of government as can be conceived as existing next
above that of the family, worthy to be called human government, still
exists among the barbarians inhabiting some portions of Central Africa,
some of the East India Islands, and perhaps some of the South Sea
Islands. These people unite in bands or tribes, and rove about seeking
the means of subsistence and endeavoring to conquer other tribes.
Some have central points of rendezvous, where the rudest habitations
are constructed, in which the women and children remain during the
absence of the men. The women almost universally are considered
very much in the light of slaves by all these nomadic tribes, and as
only fit to minister to their passions and to perform their drudgery.
Their language is as rude as their habits, consisting of little more than
a comparatively few spasmodically uttered harsh sounds. Written
language they have none, excepting perhaps some images or rude figures
symbolizing some special event they in this way attempt to commemorate,
and which may be considered as the foundation of it for the
tribes using them as they were the primary foundation of all written
language.</p>

<p class='c008'>One notable feature is universally observable among all these representatives
of primitive government—they all recognize the necessity
of a leader under some of the many forms of control exercised by the
one over the many, and he is generally one who has exhibited some
particular prowess in battle, the capacity to perform which he is supposed
to be endowed with by some unknown power, and which renders
him superior to all others, and best capable of ruling and protecting
those who thus recognize him, and who obey him in every particular,
even to sacrificing their lives. Such may be considered an outline
of our conceptions of the most primitive form of government of the
present day; and the fact that such still exists has a marked bearing
upon the subject of general government, when it is remembered that
the time was when no higher form existed on the face of the earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>The law of evolution and that of dissolution being a universal
deduction from the philosophic ultimatum <i>that force persists</i>, they apply
to all things wherein force is exhibited; consequently human government
must be the objective result of the persistence of force exhibited
among the people of the earth, and at the same time the subject
of all modifications that grow out of its transformations and equivalent
relations. In whatever light, then, human government is viewed,
these philosophic laws should never be lost sight of nor disregarded;
but the causes of all the rises and falls, transformations, modifications
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>and amalgamations, should be sought by the application of those laws
to the objective points under consideration.</p>

<p class='c008'>The question now naturally arises, Can human government, then
be analyzed, and the facts it presents be found to correspond to the
deductions of philosophic law?</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been remarked that the simplest combinations of force
among human beings, representing government which existed when
none higher had been attained, was still represented on the earth by
certain of its inhabitants. Beginning with this as the basis of the superstructure
of human government, can there be traced a gradual scale
of progress from it to the government of this country, in which scale
each nation, tribe and tongue will find its appropriate place, which,
unoccupied, would render the scale imperfect, as a chain would be imperfect
were one of its central links missing? and would an analysis
of each of these governments develop the fact that each successive one
in the progressive scale would represent some new application of the
principle of liberty, some more extended idea of equality, or some better
formula of justice than the preceding had, which application, idea
or formula entitles it to rank superior thereto, and also determines its
position in the scale?</p>

<p class='c008'>Of all systems and forms of government that came and passed
away during the long lapse of ages, from the time the most primitive
alone existed on the earth to the time wherein those flourished that
have left records of their existence, we can know nothing except what
may be gathered from philosophic deduction unsupported by any actual
record of facts concerning them. It is, however, philosophically
certain that very many such intermediate governments did exist, variously
modified and advancing from the primitive forms. Possessing,
as we may justly infer, but little capability for duration, their integration
was rapidly succeeded by disintegration; being exposed to numerous
and different external influences, rapid and successive changes
were inevitable, because they were possessed of but little individuality
and consequently but little capacity for resisting external influences.
They were bound together by none of the higher laws of association,
but were led by transient ephemeral contingencies, combining at times
together, to soon divide and subdivide only to again form new and
equally temporary amalgamations. Thus constantly organizing and
dissolving, the long interval alluded to was occupied by primitive inhabitants
in their march from the purely homogeneous toward the individualized
times wherein civilization left records of itself.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>While no special inquiries into the correctness of the formulas laid
down at various times by various philosophers, which seek to include
and cover all the phenomena of the universe, will be made, those of
the most eminent may with propriety be stated; indeed, if it be attempted
to show that history obeys a fixed law of evolution, the law
that it is presumed to obey must be given, that it may be seen whether
the deductions arrived at are included within the limits of the formula.
If it should not so turn out, then either the deduction must be illegitimate,
the formula imperfect or impossible, or the fact made apparent,
that, while all the other sciences, as biology, psychology and their various
divisions, are known to conform to certain well determined laws of
causation, sociology, in which all history and government find their
basis, conforms to no law, but is the product of the merest chance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Until within the present century it was not claimed by any of the
various philosophers who had flourished that there was such a science
as sociology; or, if so claimed by any far-seeing mind, the attempt to
demonstrate or formulate it was not made until the time of Comte, who,
about the year 1830, did attempt it, and he may be justly styled the
father of the present system of formulated science. Though his system
is now shown to contain many imperfections and omissions, it is
nevertheless certain, that but for it, the improvements since made
would not have been possible to the present degree attained, though
those who have made them may repudiate the idea, and scorn to acknowledge
that they have built upon Comte.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gathering from his profuse writings upon this point his earlier and
most continuous opinions, the following are the terms in which they
can be the most simply expressed: Social progression is a gradual
change from rudimentary, homogeneous and anthropomorphic conditions
to civilization, heterogeneity and to definite conceptions of the
external world; and at the same time from nomadic characteristics,
with aggressive purposes, to inhabitative propensities and individual
industrial pursuits.</p>

<p class='c008'>A number of philosophers, who have written since the days of
Comte, have from time to time presented formulas which at best can
only be considered as modifications of his, and it may confidently be
asserted that no real addition was acquired until the Spencerian was
made, which, while it included Comte’s, was more general and comprehensive,
and at the same time more definite and special. This seeming
anomaly was made possible by his having discovered the law of
evolution, and by having exhaustively demonstrated that all mental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>action—emotional as well as intellectual—was included in it. It is as
follows: Evolution is an integration of matter and a concomitant dissipation
of motion, during which the matter passes from an indefinite,
incoherent homogeneity to a definite, coherent heterogeneity, and during
which the retained motion undergoes a partial transformation.
This general formula includes all evolution, organic and inorganic, and
interprets not only the genesis of the sidereal and solar systems and of
the earth, but also of life upon the earth, and has become the law of
all social, moral and intellectual change. He afterward found it necessary
to make a supplement especially applicable to organic life,
in such terms as should not include the inorganic. It was as follows:
“Life—and intelligence being the highest manifestations of life—consists
in the continuous establishment of relations within the organism,
in correspondence with relations existing within the environment or the
surroundings.”</p>

<p class='c008'>To this exhaustive statement a late generalization and specialization
has been made by Mr. Fiske, especially applicable to social evolution,
as follows: The progress of society is a continuous establishment
of psychical relations within the community, in conformity to physical
and psychical relations arising within the environment, during which,
both the community and the environment pass from a state of incoherent
homogeneity to a state of coherent heterogeneity, and during
which the constitutional units of the community become ever more
distinctly individuated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having now arrived at that point where history must furnish the
facts upon which the subject rests, it may be well to comprehensively
recapitulate a perhaps somewhat too long introduction. It was seen
that all over the face of the earth where human life was represented,
government exists, and that this government was representative of one
or another of the three orders of aggregates of individuals—the family,
the tribal, or the nations, and that an aggregate of nations would add
the fourth order. It was also seen that the evolution of government
was the objective result of the persistence of force among its component
parts. Fixing the basis of government in this philosophic fact, it was
necessary to examine the history of government to see if in its evolution
it had conformed to this law, according to present accepted formulas;
and if so found to have done, to extend the same into the future,
to ascertain if possible what the future would be. Thus by a present
understanding of the law and its tendencies, all modifications and
changes made in present systems and forms might be so made in harmony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>therewith, and not with a simple view to meet the present exigencies,
but with an understanding that would meet all exigencies of
all time, which alone is perfect legislation.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>SECOND PART OF MRS. VICTORIA C. WOODHULL’S PHILIPPIC—LAWS, PEOPLES AND COMMUNITIES FROM A FEMALE POINT OF VIEW—LESSONS IN HISTORY, POLITICS AND WAR.</h3>

<p class='c007'>[Mrs. Victoria C. Woodhull, head of the firm of female brokers in
Broad street, presents to the readers of the <cite>Herald</cite> the following communication,
the second part of her paper on “The Tendencies of Government,”
the preface to which has already appeared. Mrs. Woodhull
has undertaken the difficult task of enlightening the public mind on
the best means of running the Government machine of America.
Though her views, expressed in this paper, have a wide range, it must
be said that she is but putting herself in wind for a tremendous attack
on “the best Government the world ever saw.” Being already in the
race for the Presidency (not of the Sorosis, but of the United States),
her pronunciamentos are of course very important:]</p>

<p class='c007'>It must begin to be apparent that the proposition is, that the evolution
of government does not differ from that of simplest organic forms
either in principle or in mode of operation. The same laws that govern
the growth and multiply the plant also govern society and multiply it.
The same laws that bring fruit to perfection and dissolution perfect and
dissolve societies. The same laws that produce and control the units
of the animal kingdom produce and control the units of society. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>same law that governs the ebbing and flowing of the tides, that determines
whether the component parts of water shall exist as water or
vapor, determines the movements of society and the conditions of its
existence; and the same law that produces an earthquake here, a volcanic
eruption there or a terrific hurricane elsewhere, produces the
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and the hurricanes that are ever modifying
and changing society. Symbols of all the various processes
society passes through in its growth and extension can be found in
every other department of the universe; or, to assert the same fact differently,
everywhere in the universe there is a constant effort to attain
an equilibrium—a continuous working to supply wants, an unceasing
process of demand and supply, which are universal exemplifications of
the law that motion is always in the direction of the least resistance or
the greatest traction, or the resultant of the two operating conjointly.</p>

<p class='c008'>But what does history tell of the foundation and dissolution of
governments, and what illustrations of the law of progress does it
afford? As before stated, those who have most earnestly studied pre-historic
time have found ample evidence that the time was when the
head of the family was the highest sovereign power, and so absolute in
its character that the individual was entirely submerged in it, and State
supremacy was an impossibility. Nothing but anarchy and confusion
could have attended such rule; constant rivalry, jealousy and contention
must have kept up a continual strife between adjacent families,
which could know no settlement except through the subjugation or
destruction of the weaker of the contending parties. Of this order of
governmental aggregations, it is questionable if the earth at present
furnishes any illustrations, unless it be in some part thereof to which
the discoverer has not yet penetrated. Of the next, or tribal, order of
aggregates, it does, however; and with this second order the real
analysis and comparison must begin, though we have no objective
means of demonstrating the conditions stated as existing. When
family sovereignty was universal it can readily be seen that the continued
existence of such conditions would be impossible, for the continuous
subjugations and amalgamations of families would lead directly
to tribal communities, at first in absolute subjection to one tribe, which
would grow into some power, distributed among the several tribes. So
also would the joining together of several weak families to resist a
more powerful neighbor lead directly to confederation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The subjugation and reduction of families to bondage and slavery
was the beginning of that system of interdependence now so broadly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>extended into commerce, exchange and mutual dependence for almost
the necessities of life. In the times referred to every man was his own
farmer, tailor, carpenter and cook, and this condition was only modified
when the individuals of conquering families began to rely upon the
conquered for certain services they otherwise would have been obliged
to render themselves. All of these facts exemplify another philosophic
proposition—that for anything in the universe to remain in its homogeneous
condition is impossible, which impossibility is the result of the
fact that motion must produce change, while constant motion is inevitable
so long as force persists and matter resists.</p>

<p class='c008'>That eminent historian of the third decade of the eighteenth
century, Rollin, thus remarks of the earliest monuments which are
preserved, treating of the progress from simple to complex forms of
government:—“To know in what manner the states and kingdoms
were founded that have divided the universe, the steps whereby they
rose to that pitch of grandeur related in history, by what ties families
and cities united in order to constitute one body of society, and to live
together under the same laws and common authority, it will be necessary
to trace things back in a manner to the infancy of the world
and to those ages in which mankind, being dispersed into different
regions, began to people the earth.” In these early ages every father
was the supreme head of his family; the arbiter and judge of whatever
contests and divisions might arise within it; the natural legislator
over his little society, the defender and protector of those who, by their
birth, education and weakness, were under his protection and safeguard.
The laws which the paternal vigilance established in this domestic
senate being dictated with no other view than to promote the
general welfare, were concerted with such children as were come to
years of maturity and accepted by the inferiors with a full and free
consent, were religiously kept and preserved in families as an hereditary
polity, to which they owed their peace and security.</p>

<p class='c008'>But different motives gave rise to different laws. One man, overjoyed
at the birth of a first born son, resolved to distinguish him from
future children by bestowing on him a more considerable share of his
possessions, and giving him greater authority in his family. Another,
more attentive to the interests of a beloved wife or darling daughter,
whom he wanted to settle in the world, thought it incumbent on him
to secure her rights and increase her advantages. The solitary and
cheerless state a wife might be reduced to in case she should become
a widow affected more intimately another man, and made him provide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>beforehand for the subsistence and comfort of a woman who formed
his felicity. In proportion as every family increased by the birth of
children and their marrying into other families, they extended their
domain, and by insensible degrees formed towns and cities. From
these different views and others of a like nature arose the different
customs and rights of nations.</p>

<p class='c008'>These societies growing in time very numerous, and the families,
dividing into different branches, each having its head, it was necessary
to intrust one person with the whole in order to unite all these heads
under one authority and to maintain the public good by a uniform
administration. To heighten the lustre of this newly acquired dignity
and to cause them to devote themselves entirely to the public good,
the title of king was bestowed upon them and they were invested with
full power to administer justice and to punish crime.</p>

<p class='c008'>At first every city had its particular king, who, being more solicitous
of preserving his dominion than of enlarging it, confined his ambition
within its limits But the unavoidable feuds that break out between
neighbors, the jealousy against a more powerful rival, the turbulent
spirit of a prince, his martial disposition or thirst for aggrandizing
himself and displaying his ability, gave rise to wars which frequently
ended in the entire subjugation of the vanquished and the addition of
their cities to the victors. Thus a first victory led the way to a second,
which, making a prince more powerful and enterprising, several cities
and provinces became united under one monarch, forming kingdoms
of greater or less extent, according to the degree the victor pushed his
conquests. Such was the origin of the famous empires that at times
included the greater part of the known world.</p>

<p class='c008'>From various historical authorities the following summaries of
history are obtained, and are presented as containing some of the principal
points by which the general progress of the world should be
judged. The principal empires of ancient time will be observed separately;
those of modern time under one head, because of the more
connected character of their histories, and because of the more general
knowledge that is possessed of them. Then the general course events
took will be noticed, the deductions that legitimately flow from them
introduced, and the bearing they have upon present affairs of the world
in reference to its future condition of government considered.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are several nations that have, at various times, and that still
do claim, the greatest antiquity. The Chinese, the Indians, the Syrians
and Egyptians appear to have the most evidence to support their claim.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>The Egyptians once accorded it to the Phrygians, through the result
of the somewhat singular experiment of confining two children away
from all intercourse with the world until they began to cry, “<i>Beecos</i>,”
which was found to be the Phrygian word for bread. This word,
Psammetichus, the King decided must be of the original language, and
consequently that the Phrygians were the original people.</p>

<p class='c008'>Manetho, a high priest in Egypt, who had charge of the sacred
archives, pretends to have extracted from the writings of Mercurius
and to have proved thereby that up to the time of Alexander the
Great, whose reign began 356 years B. C., there had been thirty dynasties
in Egypt, which together covered a space of more than 5,300 years.
If this claim be allowed, Egypt has existed 7,500 years. Herodotus
says “that the Egyptian priests computed 341 generations until the
reign of Sethon,” which began 719 years B. C. “These generations,”
he adds, “make 11,341 years.” They also counted a like number of
priests and kings, who had succeeded one another without interruption,
under the name of “Pyromas,” signifying good and virtuous. These
priests hewed 341 colossal statues in wood of these Pyromas, all arranged
in a large hall in the order of their succession.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let these claims be false or true, historians unanimously agree
that Menes was the first King of Egypt, and that his reign began 2,188
years B. C., which would make its historic age about 5,000 years; undoubtedly
its fabulous age would cover a sufficient period to make
what is claimed, at least by Menetho, if not by the priests Herodotus
mentions. These claims will seem the more probable when we are informed
that a few ages only after Menes, the first King, one Busiris,
built the famous city of Thebes, and made it the seat of his empire,
which would seem to indicate that the arts and sciences had at that
time been carried to a considerable degree of perfection, not only in
the building of cities, but also in their adornment; for we are told that
the public buildings were decorated with sculptures and paintings of
the most exquisite beauty.</p>

<p class='c008'>Additional force is also given these claims by the fact that Osymandyas,
the successor of this Busiris, collected a magnificent library
at Thebes, called “The Treasury of Remedies for Diseases of the Soul,”
which would indicate that polite learning had made considerable advancement
as well in philosophy as in religion. Historians also inform
us that Cham, the father of Misriam—the same with Menes—was the
second son of Noah, and it is supposed that he retired into Africa after
the “confusion of tongues.” He was doubtless the Jupiter Ammont
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>so long worshiped as a god by the Egyptians. We are also informed
that this Cham, or Ham, had three other sons—Chus, who settled Ethiopia;
Phut, who settled Africa westward from Egypt, and Canaan in
the country that afterward was called after him, and whose descendants
were called Phœnicians.</p>

<p class='c008'>When we remember the so-called flood; that Cham was the second
son of Noah and the father of Menes, the first king, 2,189 years B. C.,
and that 200 years later Osymandyas, one of his successors, was able
to fit out an expedition against the Bactrians of Asia, consisting of
400,000 foot and 20,000 horse, it must be conceded that if the “flood”
destroyed all the people existing on the face of the earth, except those
saved in the ark, the descendants of Cham must have multiplied with
inconceivable rapidity to have made the collecting of such an army
possible. But this is not more astonishing than the supposition would
be that there could be contained in the atmosphere surrounding the
earth sufficient moisture to form the amount of water, which, falling
through a space of forty days and nights, should cover the whole earth
to the depth narrated of Noah’s flood; nor more so than that the temperature
of the whole earth at that time should have been so uniform
as to have permitted rain throughout, instead of hail or snow, in frigid
portions thereof. And if we were to inquire where such a quantity
of water was borrowed from and returned, a consistent reply would be
equally surprising; for it is now known that there is just as large a
quantity of the elements that compose water at present as there was
then.</p>

<p class='c008'>Considerable latitude can be allowed the statements regarding the
flood, when it is remembered that the knowledge of geography, astronomy
and meteorology must have been exceedingly limited at that time.
But if credence is given to it as having occurred—and it is conceded
that all the people Noah knew were destroyed by it—and a solution is
sought, it can be imagined that a tremendous upheaval of mountains
in Northern Asia might have thrown the waters of the Arctic Ocean
southward over the country Noah dwelt in; but this could not have
been the result of forty days and forty nights rain, though it may have
rained continuously during that period, and may have been considered
such by Noah.</p>

<p class='c008'>This digression was not made so much to consider the probabilities
of a flood having occurred as to give additional force to the historic
fact that but a few generations after it is said to have occurred, immense
tribes of people did exist in that portion of the world bordering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>on the eastern Mediterranean Sea, who were possessed of considerable
general knowledge, immense wealth, and, for that age, good ideas of
governmental justice; besides these people, it must also be remembered
vast hosts of barbarians existed in the more remote parts of Europe,
Asia and Africa, of whose origin and condition nothing can be positively
known, either of which bodies of people could not have descended
from Noah’s family through the common course of reproduction.</p>

<p class='c008'>What concerns this inquiry most, is not whether all or any of the
narratives of ancient writers are entitled to credence, but how and in
what directions the ancient tribal nations extended themselves and became
merged one with another. Following the history of Egypt from
the time of Menes through the reigns of his successors—Busiris, Osymandyas
(whose mausoleum displayed such extravagant magnificence),
and Euchoreus, who built the famous Memphis and made it the key to
the Nile—on through the space of two hundred and sixty years of the
Shepherd Kings, from Phœnicia to Amosis, who expelled them, and
reunited the country, and to Sesostris, the most powerful king and the
greatest conqueror the world had then known, but little evidence of increasing
proficiency in science and art is found, but much that the acquired
standard was continually being extended among the people and
among surrounding nations.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the reign of Sesostris a new era was inaugurated, and a
mighty impetus to general civilization, as well as to special advancement,
was given by his wisdom and foresight. Amenophis, the father
of Sesostris, no doubt feeling the weight of impending events, foresaw
the necessity of preparing him to meet them. He not only took great
care that his education in the arts and sciences, the principles of government,
philosophy and the art of war, should be complete, but also
caused all male children of Egypt born the same day he was, to be educated
with him, with the distinct understanding that they were to be
his future comrades, his officers, ministers and friends in the aggressive
wars he intended he should engage in when he should ascend the
throne. It is said that the celebrated Mercurius had charge over them
all, especially in politics, war and government.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first war Sesostris engaged in was against the Arabs, which
his father sent him upon while yet quite young, that he might acquire
practical knowledge in conducting military campaigns. This people,
who had never before been subdued, he conquered, and added their
country to Egypt The next year he invaded Lybia, a country to the
southwest of Egypt. During this expedition his father died, leaving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>the throne to him. He immediately formed a no less design than of
conquering the whole world. This was in 1491 B. C., and he was probably
the first of the great conquerors of ancient times who conceived
the idea of reducing the world to a single form of government, and
most assuredly the first possessed of sufficient wisdom to carry out so
gigantic an undertaking. The manner he set about to do this, and the
capacity he evinced in all the preparations, we shall have occasion to
compare hereafter with that pursued and shown by others in after time,
simply remarking here that it is safe to conclude that Sesostris was
great among the greatest; for, to boundless ambition—possessed by
many—he united the capacity to sustain it, which few can boast. While
making the most extensive preparations for raising and disciplining
armies for foreign operations, he was not less active in providing for
sustaining the dignity and power of his Government during his absence,
which he foresaw would give opportunity for rivals to attempt to overthrow
for their own benefit. His first army consisted of 600,000 foot,
24,000 horse, and 27,000 armed chariots, and its principal officers were
the 1,700 youths who had been educated with him, and who now made
it possible for him to secure perfect discipline and the greatest efficiency.</p>

<p class='c008'>With this army he first invaded and conquered Ethiopia, and made
it tributary to Egypt. He next fitted out an expedition of 400 sail,
and made himself master of all the islands and coasts of the Red Sea,
as a preparatory step to the conquest of Asia, then advanced into Asia,
subduing all the countries, even “beyond the Ganges.” Returning
westward, he conquered Scythia, Armenia, Cappadocia, Colchis, and
all Asia Minor: then crossed into Europe, and would probably have
subdued all its nations had he not encountered a great scarcity of provisions
in Thrace, which caused him to return. Herodotus says that
the Egyptian Empire extended from the Danube even beyond the
Ganges, and included all of Africa, and that all over this vast territory
there were erected pillars, on which was inscribed “Sesostris, king of
kings and lord of lords, subdued this country by the power of his arms;”
which, while it displayed a commendable spirit in marking the limits
of his conquest, it at the same time evinces a growing personal vanity
that afterward seriously tarnished his early fame.</p>

<p class='c008'>After having thus conquered the then entire known world, Sesostris
returned to Egypt with innumerable captives and laden with spoils,
and, by devoting himself to enriching and benefiting Egypt, rather than
to extending his dominions, fame and grandeur, showed that his ambition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>had expended itself in his first great campaign. From all that can
be gathered of his reign over Egypt, it must be inferred that no country
before, if since, was ever more happily disposed toward its sovereign.
The many monuments of his greatness, throughout his dominions, were
covered with inscriptions, asserting that all Sesostris’ mighty deeds were
accomplished without burdening his subjects; but, on the contrary,
they all had become able, through them, to pass the remainder of their
days in “calm and repose.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Having subdued so much of the world, had he been equally ambitious
to extend over it the same beneficent Government that he held
over Egypt—which he could easily have done through the numerous
competent persons the foresight of Amenophis had provided him with,
who were well versed in his policy and administration of affairs—Sesostris
would undoubtedly have earned and been entitled to the appellation
of the world’s benefactor. It appears, however, that he did not exert
himself at all in this direction, but was content to receive the annual
tributes he levied to enrich Egypt proper. His reasons for pursuing
this course, rather than of endeavoring to reward his most worthy adherents
by making them rulers of the countries they had assisted him
to conquer, are incomprehensible, and that they should not have urged
him to it equally so. When it is considered how wisely and happily
he governed Egypt, it can be imagined how vastly he might have benefited
the conquered people by diffusing correct knowledge of the art
of government among them through extending his rule over them.</p>

<p class='c008'>As it was, it came about, that various Egyptian colonies scattered
here and there over the conquered country, and in this way were instrumental
in spreading the wisdom of their nation. It was one of
these colonies that afterward became the famous Athens—the seat of
learning, literature and philosophy. It was about this time also that
the use of letters was introduced by one Cadmus, whom the Egyptians
claimed to be of their country; but the majority of writers agree that
they originated in Syria, and that they were identical with the Hebraic.
Of these, however, there were but sixteen, four others being added
some two hundred and fifty years later, and the remaining four a long
time afterward.</p>

<p class='c008'>The reign of Sesostris may justly be considered as having produced
more general and extended influence upon the world than that
of any of his ancestors of any country, and that nothing occurred that
can hold any degree of comparison to it until the time of Alexander,
more than a thousand years afterward. Sesostris was succeeded by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Pheron, and he by Proteus, who dedicated the beautiful temple to
“Venus the Stranger,” supposed to be “Helen of Troy,” famous for
her beauty, and who was stolen by Paris, from whom she was taken by
Proteus and returned to the Greeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under succeeding reigns, the glory of Egypt began to decline,
violence and cruelty to usurp the places where justice and moderation
had so long prevailed, and jealousies, petty malice and personal aggrandizement
to take the place of that love of country which is superior
to self; nor could aught else have been expected from the ill-advised
luxury and ease the country obtained under Sesostris, which should
have been converted into action and expended upon tributary nations.
The downward tendency, or the disintegrating process, having begun,
demonstrated that the principle upon which Egypt rose and flourished
had culminated, and was now to be disseminated among other nations
and tribes. Nor could any effort of succeeding rulers, who saw the
process at work and understood the causes thereof, stop the downward
tendency, which continued with but temporary interruptions until the
death of Tharaca, 687 years B. C., when the kingdom remained in a
state of anarchy, until twelve noblemen conspired to divide it among
themselves. For some superstitious reasons Psammetichus, one of
the twelve, was banished; but he, entering into a league with some
Greeks, made war upon the eleven, defeated them, and again united
the kingdom under one rule, and remained sole possessor of it until
his death.</p>

<p class='c008'>Six hundred and sixteen years B. C. one Nechos arose, who attempted
the cutting of a canal from the Nile to the Red Sea, but was
unsuccessful. This, however, was partly atoned for by the accomplishment
of a voyage entirely around the coast of Africa by some skilful
Phœnician sailors he employed, they leaving Egypt by the Red Sea
and returning by the way of the Mediterranean after an absence of
three years. This passage was made some 2,000 years before the Portuguese
discovered this way to the Indies, by which these Phœnicians
were able to enter the Mediterranean through the Straits of Gibraltar.</p>

<p class='c008'>Trouble after trouble now distracted the kingdom, and its power
and influence declined with every reign, until the Persians, under Cambyses,
525 years B. C., subdued it. Since the downfall of the Persian
Empire, Egypt has successively been subject to the Macedonians, Romans,
Saracens, Mamelukes, and lastly the Turks, by whom it is now
nominally possessed. The late accomplishment of the project Nechos
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>failed in may be prophetic of radical changes in the condition Egypt
has so long been submerged in—the indications being favorable for a
return to considerable importance among the nations of the earth.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>MRS. WOODHULL’S THIRD LETTER.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Nearly all historians who have written since Josephus have endeavored
to reconcile sacred and profane history. This task Rollin
attempts regarding the origin of the Assyrian empire. Diodorus says
that “Ninus, the most ancient Assyrian king, performed great actions.
Being naturally of a warlike disposition, and ambitious of glory which
results from valor, he armed a considerable number of young men that
were brave and vigorous, like himself, and trained them to all manner
of hardships.” This Ninus, Rollin endeavors to make it appear, was
the Nimrod of the Scriptures, and the Belus who was afterward worshiped
as a god. Calisthenes, a philosopher, who was one of the retinue
of Alexander the Great, says the Babylonians reckoned their origin
back some 115 years after the Deluge, which would be about 2,250
years B. C. The conflict of authority upon the origin of this empire,
renders it competent for our purpose to assume this date, and that Nimrod
was the first historic king of Assyria.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c008'>Assyria is supposed to have derived its name from Asshur, the
son of Shem, who, the Scripture says, settled this country. Nimrod
possessed himself of the province, introduced his own subjects into it,
built cities and made himself generally beloved. It is said he built
Nineveh, more grand and magnificent than all the rest, and named it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>after his son Ninus, who, on his accession to the throne, conceived the
design of extending his conquests, and began to prepare troops and
officers capable of carrying it out. In seventeen years he conquered all
the country between Egypt, India and Bactriana, which last country
he did not think himself strong enough to attack with success.</p>

<p class='c008'>While preparing for further and greater conquests he also determined
to immortalize his name by making of Nineveh a city at
once commensurate with his power and wealth. His design, says Diodorus,
was “to make it the largest and noblest city in the world, and
to put it beyond the power of others who might come after him to ever
build another such. Nor,” as Rollin adds, “was he deceived in this;
for never did any city come up to the greatness and magnificence of
this.” It was eighteen miles and three-quarters long and eleven miles
and one-quarter broad, and was surrounded by a wall one hundred
feet high.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having completed Nineveh he pursued his intended campaign
against the Bactrians, into whose country he marched an army of
1,700,000 foot, 200,000 horse and 20,000 chariots, armed with scythes.
With this vast array he quickly overran the whole country and finally
laid siege to its capital. This city was strongly fortified and stoutly
defended, so much so that Ninus began to despair of reducing it, when
the wife of one of his officers advised him how to attack its citadels so
as to capture them, and by them the city. This woman was the afterward
celebrated Semiramis. Ninus made use of her advice, and the
city fell into his hands with but little loss to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ninus, finding a woman possessed of such remarkable capacity to
aid him in his ambitious designs, at once conceived for Semiramis the
most violent passion. Her husband, upon hearing this, killed himself
to escape the fury of Ninus. Having married her, he not long after
died—some assert by her connivance—and left the kingdom to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Semiramis who undertook the building of the mighty
Babylon, in which work she employed two million men. Dr. Prideaux
tells us the walls around Babylon were three hundred and fifty feet
high and eighty feet thick, and that it contained six hundred and
seventy-six squares two miles and a quarter in circumference. His description
of the walls, the quays and bridges, lakes, ditches, canals,
palaces, hanging-gardens and temple of Belus presents a picture of
grandeur and magnificence unknown in this age. Diodorus also says
even in his time there were many monuments of grandeur still standing
bearing the name of Semiramis.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>This beautiful and extraordinary woman possessed the most marvelous
control over all she came in contact with. Her simple presence
was sufficient to quell any tumult or mutinous proceeding. Not satisfied
with the immense possessions left her by Ninus, she conquered
Ethiopia and the larger part of Africa. Not yet content, she determined
upon the subjugation of India, against which she set out
with 3,000,000 foot, 500,000 horse and a multitude of camels, with
which she thought to make head against the Indian elephants. After
she had successfully crossed the river Indus the Indian King fell upon
her army, with his elephants, with such fury that it was utterly routed.
Semiramis was by this defeat compelled to give over the conquest of
India. Having reigned forty-two years she resigned the throne to
Ninyas, her son, whom she discovered was plotting against her life, as
the Jupiter Ammon of Egypt had told her years before he would.
She retired from the sight of men, hoping speedily to have divine
honors granted her name, which was also prophesied for her by the
Egyptian god.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of these vast armies, which predicate still more vast population,
Rollin remarks: “I must own I am somewhat puzzled with a difficulty
which may be raised against the extraordinary things related of
Ninus and Semiramis, as they do not seem to agree with the times so
near the deluge; I mean such vast armies; such a numerous cavalry;
so many chariots armed with scythes; such immense treasures of silver
and gold, and the magnificence of the buildings. The temple of Belus
alone contained more than twenty millions pounds sterling hoarded
treasure.” Rollin argues that the Greek historians, from whom he compiled,
must have fallen into some grave errors, since, that such things
should have occurred so soon after the deluge, presupposes what must
have been beyond the range of possibility.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Assyrian empire, having attained the zenith of power and
magnificence under Semiramis, began to sink into a gradual decay,
the kings themselves setting the example of indolence and dissipation.
This process of decay continued until the time of Sardanapalus,
about 700 years B. C. He surpassed all his predecessors in effeminacy,
cowardice and licentious luxury, and abandoned himself completely
to pleasure, wine and women; even dressing and painting his
cheeks as the women did. It seems strange that a people so used to
glory and conquest should not have sooner revolted against such debauchery
and dissoluteness. This was left for one Arbaces to do; he
obtained entrance to the King’s palace, and with his own eyes witnessed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>the truth of the reports about the King. Arbaces at once began
to incite rebellion; by his reports he gained over the governors of several
provinces, who raised an army and marched against the King,
whom they succeeded in shutting up in the city of Nineveh. The
King considered Nineveh impregnable, but the river Tigris suddenly
rose to a great height and broke down some portions of the walls of
the city, which admitted the troops of the rebellious governors. Sardanapalus
then proceeded to burn himself, his women and treasure,
which latter, according to Atheneus, amounted to “a thousand myriads
of talents of gold and ten times as much silver, each myriad of
which was of the value of $7,000,000.” Such treasure we in this age
know nothing of. After the death of Sardanapalus the empire was
dismembered, and the kingdoms of Babylon, Nineveh and Medea
formed from its ruins. Between these there was constant warfare
waged. During the time of Cyazares a horde of Scythian barbarians
devastated the three kingdoms, remaining their masters until the people
disposed of them by a general stratagem—slaughtering them while drunk
with wine, at feasts to which, by concert, each family of Assyrians had
invited them upon an agreed day. Such as escaped this, fled the
country. Cyazares, after repeated efforts, succeeded in utterly destroying
Nineveh, the last city that held out against him, and with the aid
of his nephew, Cyrus, united the three kingdoms again under one
government, which was the beginning of the famous empire of the
Medes and Persians.</p>

<p class='c008'>Crœsus, King of Lydia, is here entitled to a slight digressive reference
on account of the influence he at this time exercised. Vast riches
in most kingdoms had led to indolence, effeminacy and licentiousness;
but Crœsus thought it unworthy for any person, much less a king, to
surrender himself to these. Not only was he vastly rich, and an extraordinary
conqueror, but his chief delight consisted in literature and
science; he patronized the learned and wise of all nations; so much
so that they all made particular effort to visit his dominions to receive
his assistance. His court was the ordinary residence of the seven wise
men of Greece. It was with him that Æsop, the author of the Fables,
flourished. The possession of these characteristics entitle Crœsus to
most honorable mention and memory, and he should be regarded as a
representative king.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be remembered that Cyrus was the first king of Persia, which
by conquest he enlarged until it comprised all the territory between the
Tigris and Indus, the Caspian Sea and Indian Ocean. His uncle, Cyazares,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>retained Medea. He, finding himself involved in a terrible war with
the kings of several provinces—among whom was Crœsus of Lidya—sent
to Cyrus for aid, who set out at once with an army. The vast preparations
made on both sides culminated in the battle of Thimbra—one of the most
remarkable events of ancient times—which decided the empire of Asia
against the Assyrians and in favor of the Persians. This battle has
always been the study of great commanders, because the military
genius there displayed by Cyrus makes him rank as one of the greatest
of generals. After reducing all the smaller nations of Asia Minor,
Cyrus turned his whole power against Babylon, which he determined
upon destroying. He accomplished its capture by emptying the river
Euphrates into the vast ditches prepared by Semiramis, and marching
his army over its dry bed into the city at night, while its inhabitants
were engaged in some general entertainment. Thus the mighty city
built by Semiramis fell, and the destruction ceased not, until not even
its walls remained to tell the story of its grandeur.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the reunion of what constituted the first Assyrian empire,
the conquests of Cyrus seem to have ceased. He turned his whole
attention to perfecting a system of government for the vast country he
had acquired. This he accomplished most wisely. All historians
agree that in this task he was greatly aided by the wisdom and counsel
of Daniel the Prophet, who obtained a position of great power and influence.
It was no doubt he who obtained from Cyrus the famous
decree regarding the Babylonish captivity of the Jews. So prosperous
and happy did the empire become under the reign of Cyrus, that historians
affirm “that after his death he was universally regarded as the
common father of the people.” Having reigned seventy years he died
529 years B. C., leaving the empire to Cambyses, his son, who was as
great in crime as his father had been in virtue. He caused the death
of his only brother, Smerdis, married his youngest sister (who was very
beautiful), and afterward killed her because she lamented the death
of Smerdis. Happily his reign was cut short by death, having lasted
less than eight years.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not generally known that Cambyses had caused the death
of his brother Smerdis, which made it possible for Smerdis the magician
to usurp the throne, giving out that he was the true Smerdis. He
was exposed by one of his wives, at the instance of a nobleman named
Darius, who managed to slay him, and was then unanimously named
king, by his brother noblemen, for having done so. Soon after becoming
king, Darius, with an army of 1,000,000 men, marched into Europe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>to chastise the Scythians for having overrun Assyria in the time of
Cyazares. The expedition resulted disastrously to Darius, who could
not even bring the Scythians to battle. They continually retired before
him, and left him to be defeated by the scarcity of provisions, from
which cause Darius came near losing his whole army, and was obliged
to beat a hasty retreat to his own country. Darius then determined
upon the conquest of India, which he accomplished. Of the particulars
of this campaign no records are left, though it is known that India
remained a Persian province many years, and paid annual tributes
of £50,0000 sterling. Darius was the only conqueror who ever subjugated
India sufficiently to reduce it to a tributary province; it made
the twentieth that had been added to Persia.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the reign of Darius, the Ionians revolted against Persian
control, and succeeded in involving the Athenians with them; they
furnished the Ionians twenty ships, by the aid of which Sardis was
captured and burned. This so enraged Darius that he formed a solemn
resolve to destroy Greece. Thus began that implacable strife of the
Persians against the Grecians, by which Persian power was almost
destroyed, and in which the Greeks performed the most remarkable
exploits known in military history. These, coming more properly under
Grecian summary, it will only be remarked here that Miltiades on
the plains of Marathon, Leonidas at Thermopylæ, Themistocles at Salamis,
Aristides at Plateæ, Leotychides at Mycale, and Simon at Eurymedon,
taught the Persian monarchs that they were not to be subdued
by them, though they should expend their mightiest power in their
attempts.</p>

<p class='c008'>So exhausted was the empire from the Grecian wars, that when
the Egyptians revolted during the reign of Darius II. he found himself
unable to subdue them. The superb empire made and left by
Cyrus the Great under such admirable government was now becoming
thoroughly corrupted and debauched, and was given to all species of
licentiousness. Its former glory rapidly departed, and the elements of
destruction were actively at work preparing it for the blow Alexander
of Macedon was soon to deal it, from which it was destined never to
recover.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the dismemberment of the Macedonian Empire, Persia in part
recovered, but became the field for constant barbarian inroads, which
kept the kingdom in poverty and misery. Under Chosron, about the
year 600, the empire again extended from the Indus to the Mediterranean.
Justinian I. waged a successful war against Chosron, and compelled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>a disadvantageous peace. This was annulled by Chosron II.,
who again raised Persia to her former greatness by conquering Egypt,
Ethiopia, Lydia and Yemen. These sudden conquests were soon lost,
and the partially resuscitated empire passed into a rapid decline. At
no time since has Persia exerted any considerable influence upon surrounding
nations. Under Timour, in the fourteenth century, and the
Turks in the fifteenth, it decayed rapidly; in the sixteenth century it
became nearly extinct, and, as a nation, it remains virtually so to this
day.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>VICTORIA C. WOODHULL’S FOURTH PAPER—A RETROSPECT OF ANCIENT GRECIAN AND ROMAN HISTORY.</h3>

<p class='c017'>[Below we present the fourth subdivision of Mrs. Woodhull’s treatise
on “The Tendencies of Government,” from which it will be perceived
that the lady has delved deep into the mines of governmental
lore, and is vigorously training for the Presidential sweepstakes of
1872:]</p>

<p class='c008'>Regarding the earliest traditions of Greece, it can be said they are
less indefinite than those of Egypt or Assyria. No country of antiquity
can be reverted to with more admiration and respect than this. In
whatever light her history is considered, illustrious examples of true
greatness abound. If her military career be reviewed, where can more
glory be found to have been achieved? If her government be examined,
where has greater wisdom and moderation ever been exercised?
If the comparative advancement of science, literature, art and philosophy
made within her domain be appealed to, where has greater proficiency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>ever been attained? If the personal characteristics of her great
men be analyzed, where has patriotism ever risen to so sublime a degree?
In many respects Greece may be considered the school-house
of the world, wherein it has been taught the rudimentary principles of
knowledge, especially that species of knowledge that conduces to the
development of wisdom.</p>

<p class='c008'>The territory of ancient Greece was by no means the Greece of to-day,
but embraced all that country lying southward from Illyria and
Thrace, now forming a part of Turkey in Europe. It then consisted
of the provinces of Epirus, Peloponnesus, Greece proper, Thessaly and
Macedonia, besides many islands in the Ægean Sea. The earliest inhabitants
of Greece of whom anything is known were the Pelasgi, who
“knew no other law than force, were ignorant even of agriculture, and
fed on roots and herbs.” A people called the Hellenes, from Asia,
mingled with them, and their common name became Greeks, from
Græcus, the son of Pelasgus. Although Greece was afterward the seat
of so much knowledge and wisdom, it does not appear that these originated
among the descendants of its original inhabitants, but that they
sprung from the Phœnecian and Egyptian colonies that from various
causes found their way into Greece.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of the constant internal strife carried on between the several Grecian
provinces no mention will be made. The first of these to arise
was Sicyon, followed by Argos, Mycenæ, Athens, Sparta, Corinth and
Macedon. When the population of any of these became large, it was
the custom to send out colonies, thus distributing Grecian influence,
instead of by war. The powerful cities of Rhegium, Syracuse, Sybaris,
Crotona, Tarentum, Gela, Locris, Messina, Marseilles and Agrigentum,
were formed from such colonies. For the space of a thousand years, or
until 520 years B. C., the Grecians appear to have confined their operations
within their own dominions. Being continually engaged in war
with each other, they had no opportunity of carrying on aggressive
warfare—this was never a Grecian characteristic, though so forcibly illustrated
by Alexander of Macedon, and by Cimon and Agesilaus, for
retaliation rather than aggression.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is to be specially observed as illustrating the part Greece performed
in the general advancement and diffusion of civilization that
while all other great nations were made so by aggressive conquests,
Greece rarely ever made war except in self-defence. The influence
other nations had upon the world was gained by conquering contiguous
countries. The influence Greece exercised was by diffusing among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>other nations the principles of science, philosophy and government and
by commercial intercourse. Thus it is found that up to the time of
the first Persian invasion there had been no concentration of the military
forces of the several provinces, except as they had taken sides
against each other in their feudal wars.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Persian attempt to subjugate Greece was most unpropitious
from the very onset. Mardonius marched a large army into the very
heart of Greece, with scarcely any opposition; but his fleet, in approaching
the coast of Macedon, encountered a storm, and was destroyed.
Meanwhile, Mardonius took no pains to encamp his vast army
in a place or form of security. A mere band of Thracians, taking advantage
of this, fell upon the Persians in the night, and completely
routed the whole army. This double defeat, by such unexpected
means, caused Mardonius to return quickly into Asia.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing daunted by this defeat, which he attributed to the inexperience
of Mardonius, Darius dispatched another army, consisting of
500,000 men and 600 ships. The fleet first captured Eretrea, while the
army caused such consternation in Greece that only Sparta, of all the
provinces, responded to the Athenian call for succor. The Spartan
troops, even, did not arrive in time to participate in the battle of Marathon,
where Miltiades, with 10,000 Athenians, completely routed the
whole Persian army. This victory gained by the Greeks over an army
outnumbering theirs nearly twenty times, was, no doubt, the inspiring
cause by which all succeeding victories over the Persians were gained.
It taught the Greeks that a few determined men, fighting in defence of
their country, were mightier than a multitude with no such incentive.
Through the course of succeeding ages the Grecians exhibited a noble
emulation of, and desire to imitate, if not excel, their ancestors, who
fought and conquered at Marathon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Xerxes, the successor of Darius, persisting in his determination
to destroy Greece, crossed the Hellespont on a “bridge of boats,” with
an army of 1,700,000 and 80,000 horse, to which submitting countries
added 300,000, so that he appeared before the pass of Thermopylæ
with 2,000,000 men. Against this force Leonidas opposed 12,000
Spartans and allies. The whole power of the Athenians had been
turned into preparations for naval warfare, which, as the sequel showed,
was the salvation of Greece. The manner in which Leonidas and his
300 Spartans defended Thermopylæ, still further raised the determination
of the Greeks to resist after the same fashion all movements of
the invaders. On the same day as the battle of Thermopylæ a great,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>though indecisive, naval battle was fought at Artemesium. Xerxes advanced
upon, captured and burned Athens. The fate of Greece seemed
decided; but the great naval battle of Salamis entirely changed the
face of affairs. Xerxes being secretly informed that it was the intention
of Themistocles to proceed with the Athenian fleet and destroy his
“bridge” across the Hellespont, precipitately abandoned Greece, leaving
Mardonius with 300,000 men and instructions to subdue Greece
“if he was able.” At the battle of Platæa, which soon followed,
Mardonius was completely defeated, and the same day the remainder
of the Persian fleet was destroyed at Mycale.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having thus rid themselves of the Persians the Athenians set
about to rebuild their city. The Spartans, fearing Athens would gain
great naval superiority over them, opposed it; thus the Grecians were
no sooner rid of a common foe than strife broke out among themselves.
This tendency arose from the process of individualization and
is specially illustrative of the progress of evolution. Athens was rebuilt,
and, as the Spartans feared, soon exceeded all other States in
power and splendor. Athens also became the centre of the arts and
sciences, knowledge of which was at this time rapidly developed.
Sparta, no longer able to endure the overbearing pride of Athens,
brought on the Peloponnesian war. This war devastated Greece and
enslaved Athens. Sparta in turn was compelled to yield to Epaminondas,
the Theban. In spite of this terrible war, poets, philosophers,
artists and statesmen continued to arise, commerce flourished and the
customs of the people were raised to the highest degree of perfection.</p>

<p class='c008'>But a time of unhappiness soon came upon this too prosperous
condition. Philip of Macedon, bold and cunning, took advantage of
the dissensions that at all times prevailed, and by a sudden <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de
main</span></i> thought to make himself master of all Greece. It can be asserted
that not Greece, but one man, for forty-eight years continually frustrated
the designs of Philip, who himself said, “The eloquence of
Demosthenes did me more harm than all the armies and fleets of the
Athenians. His harangues are like machines of war and batteries
raised at a distance, by which all my projects and enterprises are ruined.
Had I been present and heard that vehement orator declaim I should
have been the first to conclude that it was necessary to declare war
against me. Nor can I reach him with gold, for in this respect, by
which I have gained so many cities, I find him invincible.” Antipater
also says of him, “I value not the galleys nor armies of the Athenians.
Demosthenes alone I fear. Without him the Athenians are no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>better than the meanest Greeks. It is he that arouses them from their
lethargy and puts arms into their hands almost against their will.
Incessantly representing the battle of Marathon and Salamis, he transforms
them into new men. Nothing escapes his penetrating eye, nor
his consummate prudence. He foresees all our designs; he countermines
all our projects and disconcerts us in everything. Did the
Athenians confide in him and follow his advice we should be irremediably
undone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>From all that can be gathered about this remarkable man it may
seriously be considered whether, had he had the power of a Sesostris,
a Cyrus or an Alexander, he would not have conquered and ruled the
world. But the Athenians failed to follow his advice, and were reduced
to submission to Macedon by the youthful Alexander, who
said of him, when he passed Thermopylæ, “Demosthenes called me a
child when I was in Illyria; he called me a young man when I was
in Thessaly: I must now show him before Athens that I am a man
grown.”</p>

<p class='c008'>After the conquest was complete Alexander summoned at Corinth
representatives from the several Grecian States, and requested from
them the supreme command of all their armies against the Persians.
No assembly ever held was embryotic of more momentous events. It
was the Western World taking counsel and resolving upon the destruction
of the Eastern, and was the initiatory step to almost incredible
events, and to the revolutions that were to change the condition of
the whole world, through the unexampled career of him who caused its
assembling.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the death of Alexander, the several Grecian States renewed
the struggle for freedom. The Romans, who had risen in the West,
becoming involved in the strife, proved fatal to Greece; for in the year
146 B. C. the capture of Corinth reduced Greece to a Roman province.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the whole period of strife from the battle of Platæa, the
arts and sciences flourished in a most extraordinary manner. Indeed,
it was the golden age of art. The Grecian colonies were still more
prosperous than their mother country. Alexandria, in Egypt, especially,
became famous as the seat of learning. In the time of Augustus, the
Greeks lost even the shadow of their former freedom and ceased to be
an independent people; but they became the instructors of their conquerors;
for their language, manners, customs, learning, arts and tastes
spread over the whole Roman empire. After a time the Romans came
to esteem the Greeks as the most worthless of creatures.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Asiatic luxury, acquired from the Persians, had wholly corrupted the
Greek’s ancient love of freedom, and a mean servility became substituted
therefor. At the beginning of the fourth century the people scarcely
showed a single trace of their former noble characteristics of simplicity
and grandeur; and thus Greece passed into her condition of unimportance.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ROME.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Rome originally was but an insignificant city, founded on the
banks of the Tiber by some herdsmen, whose small numbers were
swelled somewhat “by strangers and outcasts from all the country
about.” The herdsmen were without doubt Pelesgians, who had previously
occupied the more easterly portions of Europe. The language
they introduced bears unmistakable evidence of similarity to the Greek.
That a people so humble as the original Romans were, who labored
principally upon an unproductive soil for sustenance, should have increased
in numbers, power and influence, so as to rule the world,
seems almost incredible; but so it was.</p>

<p class='c008'>A three-fold division of the people was early spoken of, probably
representing as many different tribes. Each of these tribes was divided
into ten smaller bodies called “Curial;” in war these divisions were
represented by thirty centuries that made up the “legion.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There were very few women among the early Romans. They
seized on some Sabine women who came among them to witness their
games, which seizure caused a war with the Sabines; the result of the
war was the union of the Sabines with the Romans, and the extension
among them of the same rules and divisions that existed among the
Romans. This first conquest was prophetic of all future conquests,
terminating as it did by the conquered country being added to Rome
to increase its territory and power. The system of conquest thus begun
continued with more or less activity during four centuries, when
Rome had acquired nearly all the country as far east as the Euphrates.
500 years B. C. Tarquin, the last king, was expelled by the Senate, and
the Roman republic began. During its first century, contentions among
themselves prevented the Romans from materially extending their conquests.
About the eightieth year of the republic the Gauls first attacked,
captured and plundered Rome; nor could the Romans expel
them until the banished Consul Camillus was recalled to command the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>armies. Soon after this, rapid strides to greatness were made, and
Rome became the centre of attraction for the world. All countries,
not already Roman, sought alliance, thereby hoping to escape conquest.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was during this time of glory that luxury was first admitted
and practised by Romans; and, as in all other countries, it laid the
foundation for future ruin, by introducing into use licentious, vicious,
and effeminate practices, where simplicity, purity and honor had previously
held full sway.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two hundred and eighty years B. C. the Carthagenians forming
an alliance with the King of Syracuse brought on the first Punic war.
The Syracusans soon deserted to the Romans and ever remained constant
to them. The Romans had now acquired such love of, and thirst
for, glory that they were considered unconquerable. In Sicily they
gained great naval victories, and Africa trembled when her fleets
neared its shores. The Carthagenians, through the advice of the Lacedemonian,
Xantippus, defeated the army commanded by Regulus and
captured him; he subsequently lost his life at the hands of the Carthagenians
for opposing at Rome the conclusion of peace. The war
continued by the advice of Regulus, turned in favor of the Romans,
and the Carthagenians were compelled to accept the terms of peace
offered by the Romans, thus ending the first Punic war.</p>

<p class='c008'>The conquest of Seguntum by the Carthagenians, contrary to the
terms of peace, led to the second Punic war, in which the celebrated
Hannibal figured so conspicuously, and for a time made Rome tremble.
From this temporary fear the Romans emerged more terrible than ever.
They not only put a stop to the victorious career of Hannibal, but
conquered Spain, and, crossing into Africa, compelled the recalling of
Hannibal to defend Carthage. The famous battle of Zama ensued, in
which both Hannibal and Scipio displayed the greatest military talent.
The study of this battle has since been the admiration of all great
military captains. The victorious Romans dictated again the terms of
peace, which Carthage was obliged to accept. Thus ended the second
Punic war.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ambition of Rome now increased to such an immoderate extent
as to threaten the reduction of the whole world to submission.
Macedon and Syria endeavored to make head against them, but nothing
could withstand the irresistible power of the perfectly disciplined
Roman legions. Macedon was glad to end the war by becoming a Roman
province, and Syria, to escape total destruction, by ceding to Rome
the larger portion of her territory.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Carthage, the former powerful rival of Rome, still existed, which
so annoyed the Romans that its destruction was determined upon and
accomplished by the third Punic war, which ended 145 years B. C.
The complete subjugation of all the Greek and Spanish provinces immediately
followed, and Roman power was unparalleled. This begat
a spirit of intolerance which goaded many of her conquered provinces
into revolt. Combining their armies, they for a time successfully resisted
the Romans. Pompey, coming into command, rapidly crushed
out all resistance. Internal contentions between the several factions
at Rome quickly followed the reduction of the formidable revolt.
Cæsar, Pompey and Crassus, more active than the rest, divided the
government between themselves. This was the first triumvirate.
Cæsar would have no equal, and Pompey could endure no superior.
The rivalry between these two powerful men was the initiatory step to
the conditions that ruined the republic. Cæsar obtained the consulate
and government of Gaul, and began to lay the foundation for his future
greatness by extending his military enterprises in all directions. He
defeated the Swiss, conquered the Germans, subdued the Belgians, reduced
the whole of Gaul, invaded Britain, imposed tributes upon the
people everywhere, and became the master spirit of the time.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Cæsar returned to Rome Pompey fled. Cæsar then became
perpetual dictator. This was about 50 years B. C. Pursuing Pompey
into Greece, Cæsar defeated him at the great battle of Pharsalia,
and thus overcame all opposition to unlimited power. In this possession
Cæsar became so intolerably overbearing that a conspiracy was
formed against him, which resulted in his death at the hands of Brutus.
The love of the people, especially the women, remained Cæsar’s,
so the new ruler found no peace. The strife between Brutus, Antony,
and Octavius waxed warm, and Rome, as in the days of Marius and
Scylla, became the scene of infamy and horror. Octavius and Antony,
overcoming all opposition, divided the empire between them. Octavius
remained in the west, Antony went to the east, and there became
enamored of Cleopatra, the Egyptian Queen, for whom he abandoned
Octavio, the sister of Octavius. This brought about a conflict, and
Octavius proceeded to the east with a great army to chastise Antony.
By the treachery of Cleopatra, whose army and navy deserted to
Octavius, Antony was totally defeated. The treachery of Cleopatra
determined him to take his life, which in turn caused her such grief
that she sought and found relief through the aspen’s bite.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Octavius thus became sole master of the mightiest empire the
world had ever beheld. It comprised nearly every country then known
under a universal monarchy. Octavius assumed the title of Augustus
Cæsar, and reigned over this mighty empire forty-five years with the
most consummate skill and prudence, and with a profound appreciation
of the position he occupied. It was during his reign that literature
flourished so extensively. The best literary age of all countries has
since been called its Augustan age, as likened to that of Rome under
him. In the thirtieth year of his reign Jesus Christ was born. The
Roman Empire at this time assumed its proudest and grandest pitch of
power and glory, which will ever be the wonder and admiration of
coming ages, until another nation shall arise to a greater and still more
glorious condition, of which Rome will forever remain prophetic until
fulfilled.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the reign of Augustus to Constantine the Great, who transferred
the capital to Byzantium, the empire sustained a series of good
and bad rule, and declined somewhat from its previous proud position.
On the death of Constantine the Great, Constantine II., Constantius
and Constance divided the empire. Constantine II. had all Europe
west of the Alps; Constantius Italy, Sicily and Africa; and Constance
Asia, Egypt and the whole East. This division was the beginning of
the great disasters that came fast upon Rome. Constantine and Constantius
being disposed of by treason, Constance usurped the whole
power; being destitute not only of all capacity for so extended
rule, but also of all honor, the empire began to disorganize. During
his reign and that of his successor, until Theodosius, about the year
400, country after country successfully revolted against the power of
Rome. Everything in which her former renown and glory consisted
degenerated, until Rome was precipitated into that condition which ultimated
in her entire destruction, so that she who so lately was the
proud mistress of the world, was unable to resist the barbarians of
Northern Europe, who extinguished her light, thereby leaving the
world in the midnight and anarchy of the “Dark Ages.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>MODERN EUROPE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>With the downfall of Rome that portion of history called ancient
ceases. The numerous provinces of Europe that had been under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Roman power were completely under the control of the various barbarians
who had destroyed that power. Out of this condition of anarchy
modern Europe rose. As it consists of a number of countries their
separate histories will not be considered; only such prominent facts
regarding the whole will be observed as seem to indicate and mark its
general progressive steps.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the fall of Rome in 476 to the time of Charlemagne in 800,
Western Europe was the scene of those operations that determined its
present divisions. The barbaric tribes that occupied it were the Vandals,
Suevi, Alans, Visigoths, Burgundians, Germans, Franks, Lombards,
Angles, Saxons and Huns. The Visigoths founded Spain; the
Angles and Saxons formed the seven kingdoms of Britain; the Germans
fixed themselves on the Danube, and from these grew all the German
States; the Lombards had Italy, and the Franks France. During this
period Mohammed founded an empire in Asia, out of the ruins of which
most of the monarchies of Western Asia arose.</p>

<p class='c008'>Charlemagne was the ruling spirit of what may be termed the
second period of modern European history, from 800 to 1074. Under
him France took form and rank as one of the first powers of the world,
and has never since been entirely divested of it. He temporarily re-established
the Western Empire, but with his death it went to pieces.
Spain was the theatre of the terrible wars between the Moors and Christians.
The seven Saxon kingdoms were united by Egbert, who became
the first King of England. The whole north of Europe was still
barbarous, and frequently poured its hordes over the civilization in the
south that was struggling for existence. The Danes ravaged England,
and became masters of it; while Germany, under Otho the Great, rose
to great power. The other present European States were still in obscurity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The third period of modern European history extended from 1074
to 1453. During this period the German Empire was the scene of constant
quarrels between the Emperors and the Popes, under the factions
called Guelphs and Ghibelines, which dimmed the lustre Otho had
conferred on it; Naples and Sicily were erected into kingdoms by the
Normans; Denmark arose to some importance under Wildemar II.; in
France, legislation and police restraints were introduced, but her power
was nearly crushed by Edward III. of England, which country was in
turn deluged in blood by the “Wars of the Roses;” Genoa and Venice
increased in rank and importance; Spain still suffered from the
Moors; Portugal became a distinct kingdom; Sweden and Norway
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>came into existence; Russia emerged from the barbaric rule of the Tartars;
Poland put on the royal dignity; Hungary and Bohemia were
added to Austria, and the Turkish Empire rose to great power, putting
an end to the Eastern Empire. The arts and sciences began to be cultivated
again in the West, and literature and learning to flourish.
Many inventions were produced, such as paper making, printing, engraving,
painting in oil, gunpowder, and the mariner’s compass, and
this brings us to the fourth period of history, which was pregnant with
events that were to modify and change the general conditions of the
world.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fourth period extended two hundred years to 1650. In it
America and the West Indies were discovered. The Reformation
brought about great changes in very many respects in nearly every
European country, many of which underwent important revolutions.
Germany made important legislative improvements; feudal government
was destroyed in France; Spain became a Christian kingdom; England
rose to great power, especially under Elizabeth; Italy divided herself
into numerous small States; Switzerland became a republic; the provinces
of Holland declared their independence of Spain; Poland flourished;
Denmark became of importance; affairs in Russia assumed a
new appearance, the power of the Tartars being destroyed, and the Ottoman
Empire became grand under Solyman II.</p>

<p class='c008'>About 1650, the beginning of the fifth historic period, the political
systems of Europe began to undergo considerable change, which,
from various causes, continued until the time of Bonaparte. Revolutions
in England, France, Germany and Russia caused various modifications,
not only in the limits of the various countries, but also in
their governments. England and France seemed to divide the other
Powers about equally in the support and continuance of their wars;
the general configuration of Europe, however, did not sustain any radical
changes. This period is important in another and new aspect.
Colonies from all the western kingdoms were continually going to the
new America—that country which should in future exercise such control
over the destinies of the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>From time to time in the history of the world there have arisen
single great men who by the grandeur of their enterprises and the power
of their intellect and ambition, have left indelible impressions of themselves
upon its history and condition. Such were Sesostris, Cyrus, Alexander,
Cæsar and Charlemagne. Though they all possessed many
traits of character which the present age cannot admire, they must ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>be regarded as having given general civilization those great impulses
that have so rapidly evolved the world from barbarism.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the beginning of the next period another great man appeared,
the waves of whose power were felt over the whole world, and who, by
the grandeur of his conceptions, power and executive will, rose from
obscurity to dictate to Europe, which was at that time the world.
From 1789 to 1815 may justly be styled the Bonapartean period. It
would be superfluous to recapitulate his career; nor would it be less so
to trace the rescuing of America from the savages by the resistless advance
of civilization, which, since the settlement of Jamestown, in
1607, has made such unexampled progress in all things that pertain
to greatness, grandeur and glory—in literature, science, art and government.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before closing the <i>resume</i> of general history it should be observed
that many great events have been passed unnoticed, the principal aim
having been to follow the western tendency of empire, and to present
only such facts as were prominent in forming standards of progress,
perpetual landmarks and historic eras. In Asia particularly, great
events occurred, such as the career of Ghengis Khan and Tamerlane.
The former, it is computed, slaughtered fifteen millions of human beings
during his reign. The efforts of such as he were the last struggles of
barbarians to arrest the onward course of general progress. Though
for a time triumphant in their course the genius of progress could
never be entirely eradicated where once it had found root and growth.
China and India have been passed because, for the most part, they have
been confined within themselves; the reason whereof will be discussed
hereafter.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>VICTORIA C. WOODHULL’S LAST LESSON IN POLITICAL HISTORY.</h3>

<p class='c017'>[The following communication from Mrs. Woodhull, who, as the
public is already informed, has devoted herself to enlightenment on the
question of government, will be found as interesting as any of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>previous letters on the same subject This is Mrs. Woodhull’s concluding
letter on the Tendencies of Government:]</p>

<p class='c008'>In entering upon the next and third part of the subject, we are
conscious of the imperfect construction of the second. It must be remembered
that the purpose of the <i>resume</i> was not to give consecutive
historic detail, but to mark such special facts as evidently show there
was a progressive and consecutive rise and fall of nations. Without
apology for omissions and minor errors, we proceed to the consideration
whether the facts elicited from history form a consecutive chain of
progress, by which the world has been evolved from barbarism, and
whether this evolution has been according to present philosophic formulas.
The first and most prominent fact that becomes obvious to the
observer of general history is that the progress of empire has always
been from the east, westward. The progress of the earth in its daily
rotation upon its own axis and also in its orbital movement around the
sun is toward the east. This is believed to explain the order maintained
by the course of empire. Motion being in the direction of the
least resistance, the general tendency of the surface influence of the
earth must be west. Counter side influences have at times caused deviations
from straight lines, but this only makes the general proposition
still more forcible. Therefore, as a general proposition, the course
of empire and of civilization and population has always been westward.</p>

<p class='c008'>If this proposition is applied to pre-historic times, to govern deductions
regarding it, neither Assyria nor Egypt can be considered as having
been the first powerful empire of the world. It is known that in
them there existed a numerous and powerful people of whom history
fails to give the exact or even supposed origin; the same is true of all
the surrounding countries, in Europe, Asia and Africa. If it is allowed
that population has resulted from the same general law that civilization
has, it must be admitted that China and India were the predecessors
of Assyria and Egypt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Allowing that China and India existed as vast tribal communities
previous to the historic age of Assyria and Egypt, it will be seen
that population, general civilization and improving government crossed
Asia westward and developed the Assyrian Empire, which, for the same
general reasons must be held the predecessor of Egypt.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Assyrian Empire attained its greatest power under Semiramis,
2,150 years B. C., which was about the beginning of the historic age
of Egypt, and 700 years before Sesostris conquered the greater part of
the known world. In whatever comparative light the histories of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>two countries are viewed, Assyria must be deemed the more ancient
empire. It may be further observed, if Nimrod was the first King of
Assyria, and the father of Ninus, who was the husband of Semiramis,
the empire came to its greatest glory in an exceedingly short time.
Very many reasons can be assigned why Assyria must have been an
empire of centuries when Semiramis reigned.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Assyrian Empire, in the year 2,150 B. C., was the great power
of the world, having sway over the greater part of Asia and Africa.
Seven hundred years afterward, or 1,499 years B. C., Egypt had risen
to its greatest glory, and under Sesostris acquired the Assyrian Empire,
besides a vast country in Europe and Africa which Semiramis had never
subdued.</p>

<p class='c008'>Out of the ruins of Assyria, Babylon, Nineveh and Medea were
formed, and, after being consolidated, were merged into the famous
Persian Empire by Cyrus, 536 years B. C., or 950 years after the proudest
Egyptian period. The Persian Empire absorbed the Indian and
Egyptian, and became the most splendid power that had existed, and
with rising Greece divided the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Grecian power being concentrated by Alexander of Macedon, he
acquired the ascendancy over the Persians, and became the world’s
conqueror. Numerous Grecian colonies, following the general tide of
influence westward, formed powerful kingdoms in various parts of the
Mediterranean coasts and islands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rome, rising to power, contended with Carthage for supremacy in
the west. Carthage being destroyed by the three Punic wars, the
attention of Roman armies was turned eastward, to gather in the elder
empires that were verging on decay. Greece, 146 years B. C., became
the Roman province of Achaia. Continuing its conquests further, fifty
years B. C., Rome became ruler of a greater part of the inhabited world
than any of the previous empires, and existed in the utmost pomp and
glory several centuries, until the northern barbarians swept over and
extinguished it.</p>

<p class='c008'>No considerable Power existed after 476, until Charlemagne’s,
though some influence attached to several Asiatic countries. Civilized
nations were extinct in Europe. From Charlemagne, in 800, to 1500,
civilization continued to rear its blighted head in various parts of Europe,
and to mark the countries that should play the next last act in
the drama of unceasing general progress.</p>

<p class='c008'>The historic age of the world, then, has been occupied thus: The
Assyrian Empire existed and was subdued by the Egyptian, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>was conquered by the Persian, which was destroyed by the Grecian,
which was compelled to yield to the Roman, which was destroyed by
the barbarians, that from its ashes numerous kingdoms and empires
should arise, to exist together, and to spread over and occupy the outside
world Rome had never known.</p>

<p class='c008'>From this succession of empire many deductions might be drawn
which would assist in forming a well-defined line of progress. Many
are so obvious that it would be superfluous to name them; therefore
we leave them, with the general observation, that in each succeeding
empire the condition of the people was more directly and distinctly
recognized, while each, in grasping for universal sway, and not possessing
the principles upon which universal government was possible, exceeded
the limits of its central strength, and thereby fell. India and
China alone, of all ancient nations, survive, because they have never
sought to extend their limits, but have expended their strength within
their own, though it often was in war.</p>

<p class='c008'>The commercial greatness of England, more than any other present
externally apparent power, is promoting the general assimilation
of the world. This influence is producing very great and diffusive results
in Asia, Africa and South America, and the way is being opened
and cleared for more radical and general control. It is impossible that
the increasing power of civilized and enlightened ideas and customs in
India, China and Asia generally, should not revolutionize those countries.
Many Chinese will return from this country, carrying with them
the solvent power of the genius of our institutions, which, combining
with all similar powers, will ere long kindle the flame of popular individual
freedom. This flame will cause republics to spring into existence
where one form of government has existed through historic time
over the same defined limits of kingdom. Another great and powerful
influence is being evolved that cannot fail to exercise a tremendous
modifying power over Asia. Russia, the European giant, is slowly but
surely pushing into Asia from the west. If it continue its present
well-consolidated home strength, it will absorb Asia until it meet the
same absorbing process proceeding westward, when Asia will be prepared
for a still grander consummation.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Europe, Russian influence is also gaining the ascendancy.
Though one of the youngest of European kingdoms, it seems possessed
of an inherent strength superior to them all, which Bonaparte, with all
his terrible power and ambition, could not scatter nor weaken, and
which stands ever ready to gather under its protecting wings the sickening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>adjacent kingdoms. At present Russia is biding her time and
strengthening her arms, which she is conscious shall soon reach out
and grasp all they can compass.</p>

<p class='c008'>Prussia, meantime, is spending its strength in the vain, though apparently
successful, endeavor to consolidate a country under absolute
control, that is impossible of a people so numerously and diffusively
represented, in a country where freedom is the rule. Throughout
Southern, Central and Southwestern Europe, republicanism impatiently
awaits the time to burst forth, and sweep among the debris of the
past all traces of monarchy. The country over which the Roman
eagles triumphed will again be under a republican form of government,
improved upon that of Rome by 2,000 years of successful experiment.
Russia will then occupy a central position between the republics of
Europe and Asia, and its emperors be the last to yield their crowns.
Like no other country, Russia has vast possessions in the unyielding
frigid zone, which gives way but slowly before the gradually equalizing
temperature of the globe, and of the character of which Russian Government
naturally partakes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though revolutionized, Southeastern Asia will remain China and
India, the ancient Assyrian, Persian and Grecian Empires will be resurrected
under the consolidated Russian, while Africa will be left for
Egyptian control, the promise of which begins to be visible in the direction
given to civilization and commerce by the successful accomplishment
of Nechos’ defeated project, and, Egypt returned to be a nation
of importance. Africa will naturally gravitate to Egypt, as it is
possessed of no other salient point from which dominion and power can
spring. In this regard Africa differs from all the other grand divisions
of the globe. The character of its inherent wealth is also different. Other
countries have their frozen regions, inland seas and marshes, stupendous
mountains and deep jungles, but Africa alone has its Sahara. Commerce
has scattered the germs of civilization here and there upon the
coasts of Africa, but its central portions are to all intents as undeveloped
as when Semiramis went into Ethiopia, and Sesostris levied his
tributes of gold, silver, precious stones and woods. What Africa is
held in reserve for by the general economy of the universe it is impossible
to determine; but that a time will come when her resources will
be required and obtained, is philosophically certain.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Europe, where the more prominent scenes of modern history
have been enacted, a modified method of conquest was begun by its
countries, resembling that which was pursued by ancient Greece. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>was not so much a subdual of foreign countries to actual control as it was
the general diffusion among them of civilization upon a more extended
scale, made possible by improvements in the art of navigation. The
assimilation of the world was thus begun upon a more perfect basis
than by force of arms, and which differed widely from it in this fact:
that while arbitrary control was at all times open to overthrow, the process
of becoming alike, could never be interrupted except by the suspension
of intercourse. Under the former, no two empires could exist
side by side for any length of time without one being subjugated by
the other; under the latter a number of kingdoms have existed for
centuries, and though frequently engaged in conflict to settle some
dispute of boundary or policy, it has seldom been pursued to utter
destruction. The same end grasped for by Semiramis first and by Bonaparte
last is being reached by the much more certain though gradual
process of assimilation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus far America has been untouched, but its consideration now
becomes necessary. The Old World, as has been found, must continue
its evolution, until like conditions shall exist everywhere. Similar
interests beget union. When the general people shall begin to realize
that their common interests depend upon the interests of each individual,
one system of government must follow, whether it proceed
from one common centre or from several centres.</p>

<p class='c008'>What is America? Americus Vespucius and Christopher Columbus,
acting upon sound scientific principles, discovered to the inhabitants
of the Old World a new country, that was to be a haven of retreat
for such of them as sought greater freedom and better equality,
in which individuality could expand without coming in contact and
being dwarfed by personal government. In continuing to be this haven
of retreat it has become the representative country of the world. To
its hospitable and ever-inviting shores people of all nations and climes
have come, so that in two centuries the principal country of it has
grown to be a Nation of more inherent strength than any country of
the Old World, and to rank among its nations as a first class Power,
both feared and respected.</p>

<p class='c008'>The United States of America, all genuine Americans believe,
will become the United American States. The very name is prophetic
of what shall be, while the progress made in that direction begins to
give well-defined outlines of it. Beginning on the Atlantic coast an
infant republic, the United States has stretched its arms westward
across the Continent. The same oceans that bound the east and west
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>of the Old World wash its eastern and western shores. Having gained
ocean-bound limits latitudinally, which form a central basis of strength,
it will expand longitudinally until it shall become an ocean-bound republic—a
grand confederation of States and interests, which, while
being peculiarly American, will be so far cosmopolitan as to represent
the descendants of every nation of the world—we no longer say of the
known world. Europe has its well-defined limits of kingdoms and
states, the people of which seldom pass from one to the other to become
citizens; so also has Asia, while Africa is more nearly homogeneous;
but they all give up their people to America. America, besides
being American, is European, Asiatic and African, while each of
these is becoming American. No well-informed person doubts that
the progressive greatness, of republican forms of government, is rapidly
dissolving the strength and solidity of all the monarchies of the
Old World; though they may affect to despise republics, and to call
ours a failure, their subjects are anxiously asking, When can we successfully
revolutionize? Though such a step may not be openly advocated
by any, it is, nevertheless, secretly discussed, and preparatory
means are being devised, in every country.</p>

<p class='c008'>And for these reasons the United American States will be the
representative country of the world. Some may argue, because the
commercial power of England is so superior; because she has such numerous
general possessions, the English language being the one that
must become universally used, that, by virtue of these, that dignity
belongs to England. The fact cited above, showing that the general
disintegrating influence of the world centres and is integrated in the
United States, is a sufficient answer to such an illegitimate argument—illegitimate,
because it is evident to all, that the process of the diffusion
of English influence throughout the world is, so far as England is
concerned, one of disintegration; while that going on upon American
soil is diametrically opposite, being most decidedly one of integration.
If the process of integration is pursued until it culminates, and the
argument is educed that disintegration must follow in America as it
has in England, it may be answered that the English influence that is
being diffused world-wide is peculiarly English; while, when that process
shall have commenced in America, it will proceed from a centre
formed by previous influx from all countries in the world, and in this
sense is not a process of disintegration, but simply of reaction.</p>

<p class='c008'>The general law of direction for population and civilization was
westward until it had encircled the globe, and in their last conquest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>found a country of sufficient inherent vitality to attract all other countries
toward it. Not only does the tide of influence continue to flow
to America from the east, but since her power has made itself felt
upon the Pacific coast, the same tide has set in from the west, and Asia
pours her surplus population upon our western coast, which exemplifies
one of the modifying portions of the rule of motion. For the
time, therefore, though preponderant commercial importance must be
accorded England, the United States thereby loses none of its general
prestige as the representative country of the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>From whatever point consideration begins, the conclusion that is
inevitably reached is, that the world must, in due time, become subject
to one system of government. Whether that system shall at first proceed
from one common centre or from several centres, is not so
presently apparent, though that such a consolidation will be ultimately
reached no one can doubt, who gives proper weight to the established
fact that all perfect things become universal. So it is with everything
of vital interest to the general people; rapid and sufficient communication
is the only limiting power that controls their diffusion. In proportion
as the diffusive means increase, in number and extent, so do
the interests of the people become proportionately assimilated and best
systems prevail.</p>

<p class='c008'>A striking exemplification of the benefit that would flow from the
adoption of general systems in all things may be drawn from the system
of international telegraphing. A universal language in this becomes
of the first importance. How much more important when the
general uses and benefits are considered. The adoption of a universal
language would remove the greatest obstacle from the path of the general
diffusion of knowledge and innumerable difficulties from methods
of communication.</p>

<p class='c008'>It should be further observed, that the same law governs in all
communications between the different countries. This is a necessity,
in order that the intercourse may be preserved and be at all times safe.
Should it be inquired, how much of the common law of the world is
similar, the answer returned would astonish all who had not given it
consideration, by being so considerable a portion of the whole. Were
the inquiry pressed further, to find how great modifications of
common law would be required in the various nations to make
a common administration possible to all, a still greater astonishment
would be developed by the slight disparities that would be shown to
exist.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>It has been remarked that England has possessions in very many
latitudes and longitudes of the world. Over these possessions a governing
control is exercised, which control foreshadows the possibility of
a government that shall control every country in all latitudes and
longitudes. When it is remembered that the countries of Asia are
practically as near Washington as California, there can be no argument
deduced from distance against a common and world-wide administration
of government. The broad assertion is made, that there
is no argument against universal governmental administration, but
that every possible argument urges all people to prepare for it as the
thing of all things to be desired by them.</p>

<p class='c008'>It only remains for some one of the great countries of the world
to arrive at, or to approximate to, a perfect system of government that
shall contain the elements and principles of sufficient inherent strength,
to insure to that country the power which shall control the destinies of
the world. From what has been said regarding the position of the
United States, it must be admitted, that nearly all the natural advantages,
as well as the general order of things, are on this side of the
globe. If any conclusions naturally flow from the observation of the
past tendencies in the order of nature, they are that the United States
is destined to be the centre of a universal government.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tendencies of government from earliest historic time have persistently
been to universal sway. The systems and forms through
which this tendency has been manifested have changed from time to
time, as the circumstances that created them—the environment—the
sum total of the governed—have changed. These systems will continue
to be modified, until this tendency shall have opened such channels for
itself, as will permit free and untrammeled action; until these channels
shall have encircled the world, and its utmost limits shall have
been attracted within the realm of its positive flow and negative
reaction, and until the commanding magnetic influence that
shall proceed from its central seat of power shall reach all subjects
and find in their general heart an answering response of fidelity and
confidence.</p>

<p class='c008'>In such fidelity and confidence each and all can safely and earnestly
devote themselves to the best aims and wisest purposes of life—to
intellectual, moral and spiritual growth. In this general and universal
pursuit the millennium, so long prophesied and prayed for, can
alone be gained, through which reaching, the government of heaven
can alone be administered on earth.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Government, then, will be no longer one of physical force, but of
the more powerful control of wisdom, including, perhaps, modified
forms of force. Caste will no longer be distinction regarding material
position or possession, but in moral and spiritual position and intellectual
possession. In such government and caste a true aristocracy
can exist in the midst of a true democracy. All will be born free and
entitled to the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness
in self-chosen paths, which alone is perfect equality. Perfect
equality in the order of nature does not presuppose that all shall be
alike, but it does presuppose that all shall be equal in the right to apply
their natural or acquired talent according to the dictates of the
power that governs them—the same as the flower and the tree follow
their natural courses, and are equal, but not alike. As the lightning
and the sunshine, the mountain and the river, the bird and the bee, the
earthquake and the storm, follow their natural courses and tendencies
under the government of the universal God, so shall the people follow
theirs under a universal social government, when fashioned after the
same general principles that obtain in the domain of nature. For</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Honest nature’s voice shall give</div>
      <div class='line'>The laws to man by which he’ll live.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It will be seen, then, that the philosophic formulæ that it has
been demonstrated the evolution of matter conforms to, apply with
equal force, effect and directness to the evolution of society, which is
the fruit, so to speak, of the evolution of matter. The evolution of
society, then, is “a continuous establishment of psychical relations
within the community, in conformity to physical and psychical relations
arising within the environment, during which both the community and
the environment pass from a state of incoherent homogeneity to a state
of coherent heterogeneity, and during which the constitutional units of
the community become ever more distinctly individualized.” Thus it
has been from the earliest existence of communities, and this formulæ
applies to all communities, whether Assyrian or American.</p>

<p class='c008'>The process of revolution in its ultimate effects brings about a
perfect state of action and reaction in all the various productions of
nature, by which they are first perfected and then destroyed. The
process in society must also continue until an equilibrium shall have
been attained between the governing power and the power governed.
When this is reached its perpetual continuance will depend solely upon
the perpetuity of that over which it acts, or upon continuous individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>existence. Continuous existence does not belong to the kingdoms below
man, but does to man, from the fact that inherent within his consciousness
there is a persistent though utterly unexplainable and undefinable
knowledge of continuous existence, which is forever independent
of all the changeable circumstances of the purely material, and
which represents in him that characteristic of Divine power exhibited
everywhere in the universe which is forever beyond scrutiny and limitation.</p>

<p class='c008'>This evidence of Divine power within the individual, then, is the
distinction between man as the product of nature and all other products
of nature; while the consciousness of its existence is the direct
evidence to the understanding that as the Divine power is eternal, so
must that within be, which partakes of it, or is made up of its essential
attributes.</p>

<p class='c008'>It becomes the duty, then, of each individual who can catch but
faint glimpses of such a consummation as universal government, to
point it out and to assist by all legitimate means in the dissemination
of light upon it and all relevant subjects. It becomes the duty of each
nation to see that its people are educated to the same ultimate perception;
and specially does it become the duty of that nation which seems
appointed by the Divine order of things to become the central power
of all the rest to push its influence and the genius of its institutions
abroad and into every nation. A mere passive acquiescence in this
Divine appointment will not suffice; an active and positive acceptance
of the mission, and the faithful and persistent performance of the great
trust, is required.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the people of this country shall rise to a true and competent
conception of the responsibilities of the position assigned it in the
order of the universe, the present system of things will undergo such
rapid transformations as no revolution ever yet accomplished, and to
which the destruction of the Roman empire by the barbarians can alone
compare in magnitude. By that the dominion of the world was wrested
from Rome; by this that shall come, it shall be restored to that country
of which Rome was the Divine prophecy. Personal, sectional and national
motives will be sunk in oblivion, and such governing rules of
action will obtain as shall bring the world into intimate, harmonious
and Divine relations, such as will know no Jew nor Christian, Mohammedan
nor Pagan, but one general and acknowledged brotherhood of
man, flowing from the common fatherhood of God.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>WOMAN’S IDEA OF GOVERNMENT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The public have, during the past few months, been interested and
perhaps edified by the ideas and impressions put forth by Mrs. Victoria
C. Woodhull upon the broad, general subject of human government,
as well as by her subsequent nomination of herself as a candidate
for the Presidency in the election of 1872. The articles in which she
has announced these views and purposes have from time to time appeared
in the <cite>Herald</cite>, and to-day we present a further communication on
the question of the “Limits and Sphere of Government.” It is evident
Mrs. Woodhull is imbued with at least one very sensible idea, and that
idea is one which it would be well for large numbers of aspirants for
public positions to emulate—viz., that fitness is the first prerequisite
of qualifications entitling the seeker to enjoy the position sought for.
This it is, doubtless, which has led her not only to study and perfect
herself in the nature of the functions she seeks to exercise, and their
effect, but, in the honest belief that she does understand the question,
to give her opinions to the people, that they may judge of her ability
and the correctness of her views.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the same time it is somewhat difficult to see what good will
come out of this particular Nazareth. Mrs. Woodhull offers herself in
apparent good faith as a candidate, and perhaps has a remote impression,
or rather hope, that she may be elected, but it seems that she is
rather in advance of her time. The public mind is not yet educated
to the pitch of universal woman’s rights. At present man, in his affection
for and kindness toward the weaker sex, is disposed to accord her
any reasonable number of privileges. Beyond that stage he pauses,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>because there seems to him to be a something which is unnatural in
permitting her to share the turmoil, the excitement, the risks of competition
for the glory of governing. There is therefore but one position
that may be taken in considering the aim of this ambitious lady, and
that is that, perceiving and fully appreciating the natural obtuseness
of man, she has boldly put herself forward with a view to wearing
down these scrupulous angles in his sympathetic character and nature,
and that she will, after all, be content with the knowledge that she has
done her full share in educating him for the new order of things which
shall supervene when woman, in all matters, has equal rights and duties
with him.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>MRS. WOODHULL’S LATEST EPISTLE TO THE AMERICANS—“THE LIMITS AND SPHERE OF GOVERNMENT” CONSIDERED FROM A FEMALE POINT OF VIEW.</h3>

<p class='c017'>[In the following communication Mrs. Woodhull, whose former
essays on political matters have been published in the <span class='sc'>Herald</span>, considers
the question of government with special reference to the system
under which we live in the United States:]</p>

<p class='c007'>Having in “The Tendencies of Government” traced the rise and
fall of nations, and found that from earliest historic time to the present,
there has been a continual grasping for universal power, and a constant
failure to maintain the extent of control actually reached; that the
systems through which universal control was sought were too imperfect
to admit of support for any great length of time over an extended
area of country; that the general order of the world seems to indicate
that universal government will become a fact, and that the United
States shall be the seat of such governmental power, we may now come
to consider what control a government must be invested with in order
that it shall at all times meet the demands of the people and the times,
and therefore be continuous while becoming universal.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is predicated that government exists by the consent of the governed.
While this is nominally true, it virtually contains but an undeveloped
germ of truth. In no country as yet does the government
exist by the consent of the governed. In this country least of all does
it apply, though superficially it may not so appear.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Government is universal. All things in all the various kingdoms
of nature are the objects of governing laws which form the subjective
order of the universe. In all natural government the relations between
the governing power and the powers governed are always well
defined, while the requirements of the governed are always met by
requisite modes of administration. Each coming demand falls into
some common method of being answered. Thus, in the greatest conceivable
diversity of conditions, are found the fewest and simplest laws
of control. Rising from purely material to the more refined powers
of mind, represented only in the human, a new phase of development
springs up. Being an individualized power within itself, the human
family represents the divine power that controls the whole, and in this
relation fashions its governments according to the limitations of its acquired
standard of wisdom, which must always necessarily be imperfect
in comparison with the common laws of the universe, in the same
proportion as human wisdom is imperfect when compared with divine
wisdom.</p>

<p class='c008'>The world of mind has now arrived at an age and corresponding
development, which begins to comprehend the general laws of the universe,
and to understand their great simplicity and perfect adaptation
to all things under them. Seeing that such a perfect system of government
exists throughout the universe of matter, the inquiry is beginning
to be earnestly made, why the universe of mind cannot be controlled
by equally simple and general laws and systems of administration.
Seeing that changes are never necessary in the common universal
laws, the inquiry is also beginning to be made, why the laws that govern
society cannot be so fashioned after the laws of nature as not to
require the constant remodelling now necessary when changes come, in
the circumstances required to be met.</p>

<p class='c008'>The solution of the difficulty in which the mind becomes involved
when considering these most serious questions, seems reduced to a single
proposition—that all strifes, difficulties and controversies regarding
government and its administration, arise from the fact, that the governing
power is not general but specific in its operations, or that the powers
governed are not subservient to a common law of control. This is
still more clearly perceptible if the question of “reserved rights” on
the part of any of the governed is considered. No individual can have
a reservation that militates against the general welfare of others, or the
whole, without specific laws to sustain him in it. If no individual
can have such special reservation, no number of individuals less than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>than the whole, can have reservations without specific protection.
Therefore no city, county, State, or number of them, less than all cities,
counties and States forming a consolidated union, can hold in reserve
any rights or privileges that do not contribute to the general welfare
of the whole, without sooner or later coming into conflict regarding
them. This theory of reserved rights was pretty forcibly, logically
and effectually refuted by the late war; so must all such reservations
be equally well refuted before permanent peace, harmony and prosperity
can be expected to flow from government and it remain permanent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Analytically and philosophically considered, government exists
for the general good of all the governed, in which individual rights
and privileges can find freedom and justice without conflict. All systems
that exist upon a less comprehensive basis than this must eventually
be swept away. All parts of systems that conflict with the general
fundamental propositions in which they were based and reared
must be expunged, so that administration can be in perfect harmony
with profession, before it will be possible for general good to flow from
administration. The fundamental propositions upon which this government
professes to rest—that all men and women are born free and
equal and entitled to the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness—are in accordance with the general order of the
universe below man, and are therefore of the highest possible authority.</p>

<p class='c008'>That all are born free is a proposition that no one can question;
but this freedom is general to all, and does not refer to the individual,
nor entitle him or her to push his freedom so as to encroach upon the
same freedom guaranteed to every other individual. Therefore, individual
freedom is merged in, and is a part of, general freedom.</p>

<p class='c008'>That all men and women are born equal is another strictly philosophic
proposition that can never be refuted by the concurrent scientific
truth that no two of the whole are born alike in every particular. Equality,
in a philosophic sense, does not imply similarity or even likeness; one
thing may be equal to another, or a number of others, and still be unlike
them all. A pound of feathers is equal to a pound of lead in gravitating
power, but the lead does not resemble the feathers in any respect;
hence, equality does not presuppose likeness.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pursuit of happiness is an additional common right, naturally
resulting from freedom and equality, and which can be prosecuted in
any direction that does not interfere with the general pursuit of it on
the part of the whole. From this analysis of inherent rights it would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>seem that it should be the sphere of government to maintain such freedom
and equality, and thus guarantee to all and every the pursuit of
happiness, and to protect them therein; and, co-relatively, that the
limits of government should be nothing less than the circle that will
permit such fatherly—such motherly—control.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will scarcely be questioned by those who accept the evolution
of government as a common law, that the government of this country,
as a system, comes nearer being an exponent of the philosophic limit
and sphere than that of any other country, though it must be confessed
that the practices under it belie its fundamental principles. So much
is this true, that, while it is safe to assert of the system that it is the
best of all, scarcely one can be named wherein so great distinctions
obtain between the intentions of the system and the effects obtained by
its administration. This follows because, having asserted fundamental
principles of freedom and justice, the lines of policy pursued have not
been shaped by them. The principles have been lost sight of in the
pursuit of party and personal or sectional policies, so that the government
is no longer an exponent of principles, but rather of the persons,
parties or sections which have raised themselves above principles as
authorities: hence the government has limitations put upon the operations
of its principles, and becomes thereby inconsistent within itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the corrupt practices that are prevalent in the various parts of
the governing process are possible only because the professions and
practices of government are not in harmony. The professions of government
relate to principles; the practices to its limits and sphere.
Therefore, in the present article, the practices will be dealt with. In
dealing with them it will come within the intended limits to examine
the machinery by which government is administered, and to determine
what movements within the body of society should be under its general
control, so that all its movements may be made in harmony. Were
any other branch of government than that relating to society being examined,
its limits and sphere would be found so plainly determined
there would be no possibility of even apparent departure by the governing
control from them; for in all these the divine power is that control,
and consequently is perfect. In society, the divine power, though
the controlling element, is maintained over human minds, which are
finite and imperfect representatives of the divine power, and are thereby
incompetent to so arrange and order subservient circumstances, that
harmony shall be the only result of the combinations formed to secure
consecutive order.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>The government of this country is selected for analysis because,
as a system, it is the latest production of the social order of things, and,
consequently, the highest in the scale of evolution. It represents a
greater “coherent heterogeneity” in its construction than any other,
and its “constituent units” are more “distinctly individuated,” which
demonstrates that it is the highest order of government yet attained on
the globe. The fault in its construction is, that the powers of the constituent
units are not harmoniously related to the central power, nor to
each other, discord being the natural consequence of such inequality.
Though the constituent parts of society are in themselves imperfect,
their relations to each other and to the governing power may be so
well defined and regulated that their imperfections shall not have power
to mar the harmony of action proceeding from the central power. And
this is the point which is sought.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>GRAVELY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS CONNECTED WITH GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION AND ITS ADMINISTRATIVE DEVELOPMENT, AS VIEWED AND REVIEWED BY ONE OF THE FIRM OF FEMALE BROKERS OF WALL STREET.</h3>

<p class='c011'>There are a variety of operations, natural and artificial, by which
the proper limits and sphere of government may be illustrated. It is
desirable that some of them be presented, so as to convey a correct idea
of a perfect controlling power, which bears the same relations to the
parts controlled as government should to the people under it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cotton mills of New England are good artificial representatives
of government. In them all the various parts are compelled into unity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>of action by the controlling power evolved from coal or transformed
from water. The crude cotton is first taken and freed from all foreign
substances by “the picker;” the pure remainder is then formed into
a homogeneous mass by “the cards;” this mass is then divided and
subdivided into the different degrees of heterogeneity required, and
these are more distinctly individuated into “the webbing and filling”
by “the jacks and mules,” and are then reunited by “the webber and
loom” into cotton cloth, the ultimate result. Every part of this process
forms points of resistance more or less easily compelled into unity
of purpose. Every bobbin, spindle, shuttle and card are so many different
experiences which are required to be gone through with before
the result can be reached, while all parts of the process are going on at
the same time. The power is the government; the operatives its administrators;
the various pieces and parts of the machinery are the
people working in the several parts of the process; the cloth is the attained
civilization, while the different degrees of fineness are its progressive
steps.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus it should be with human government. It is the power resident
in the central part which should control all the processes by which
the people are guided to produce the ultimate result. It should be of
such character as to take the people in the homogeneous mass, and, by
picking, carding, spinning and weaving, compel them into a unit of
action for divine use. Every operation in nature, if analyzed, presents
the same process and similar results. A central power competent for
its purposes, through various means and avenues, controls the materials
into perfected productions, each one of which is perfect of its kind.
The sphere of this government is to produce the legitimate result; and
its limits are only bounded by the necessities of the power that the result
shall flow; but flow it must and does always.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is then predicated, that a power, competent to produce harmony
in that over which it reigns, must be sufficient to control all the different
parts to one end; whatever individual or combined points of resistance
may be raised to its edicts must yield to the general purpose, even to
the extinction of their resistance. It is necessary, therefore, that the
governing power must be invested by the governed with the necessary
control, to compel them into harmonious action, so that no antagonism
may arise, to divert the tendency to unity of purpose. It must not be
supposed that a self-constituted, absolute power is argued for; but this
power should be one fashioned and organized by and with the consent
of the people, who, knowing their weakness and acknowledging it in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>their sober and wiser moments, shall recognize the necessity of it, to
compel them, if need be, to act with the general whole for the general
good, even if it seemingly militate against their individual good, and
which shall be of sufficient strength and diffusiveness to regulate all the
movements within the body of society.</p>

<p class='c008'>We will now proceed to the analysis of the various operations of
government, to find to what the inharmonious relations between the
governing power and the resistance are attributable, and thereby be
able to determine the required remedy. Wherever this may lead,
whatever “infallible” political dogmas it may destroy, or cherished
forms and privileges disprove, it will be pursued as relentlessly—unmercifully
if you will—as the crucible and the flame proceed to disorganize
material compounds and separate their constituent elements into
the poisonous, the nutritious and the useful, that the former may be
put away and the remainder appropriated to promote the general good.</p>

<p class='c008'>Government has its centre and its circumference. From its centre
its power is distributed to its entire circumference, measuring and shaping
the various channels through which it flows, into such form as permits
harmony in all its parts, and, having spent its positive force, is
then returned to its centre. This centre and circumference must be
the perfect body, every member of which must not only bear its proper
relations to all the other members, but must be in such accord
with them, as to permit the uninterrupted flow and action of the power
by which the whole is bound together. No individual member of it
can say to the body itself, “I have functions and rights peculiarly my
own, which, if they are not such as your general power can recognize
as contributing to the general good, you cannot interfere with.” The
member, in becoming such, merges its function and power with the
general functions and powers of the body. By consenting to become a
part of the body it gives up special sovereignty over itself and becomes
a part of the general sovereignty. By adding its life and power to the
body, it increases the sum total of its life and power and receives its
portion of the aggregated and assimilated mass. Its parts and functions
must change—if change is required—so that the power distributed
to it by the general power can perform its mission in harmony with
all its other parts. Like the body human, the body corporate must be
under one governing power, while each part is different in form from
all other parts, and performs separate—perhaps distinct—functions.
The eye may not say to the ear, nor the hand to the foot, “I have no
need of you,” for each and all, are alike dependent upon a central part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>for existence, while the central part could not itself exist without the
surrounding and distant parts. The very nature of the compact is, that
each and every part is joined in a system of mutual and reciprocal interdependence,
to which general system no member can set up for itself
any system peculiarly its own, in contradistinction or opposition to,
or to interfere with, the general system.</p>

<p class='c008'>The government of any country, originally, is a compact among a
certain number of previously separate or unorganized powers, by which
they merge and consolidate into one power, or are compelled so to do.
This power, so formed, is the governing power, which, while all parts
have contributed to its formation, is in itself superior to any power
that can be organized within its limits by any part of the originally
consolidating powers. If at any time an opposition is organized to it,
the result must either be, the reduction of the opposition or the destruction
of the confederation. For a natural illustration the human
body is again referred to.</p>

<p class='c008'>If from any cause an opposition to the harmonious action of the
general powers of the body be raised, a contest for supremacy is inevitable.
If the bowels refuse to perform their allotted part in the general
economy of the whole, a conflict ensues, and never ends until they
are returned to duty or until they demonstrate that their opposition to
the general administration is more powerful than its general power, and
that the organization must be dissolved in conformity to this power.
On the other hand, the general power cannot compel any of the constituent
parts to conform to rules and forms not operative in the whole,
nor to bear any inequality of any kind, nor to perform duty outside its
special sphere. The governing power, though superior to all, must
itself be subject to the common law of justice. Specialties of conferment
or requirement are utterly inconsistent with a perfect form of
government. The same rule of contributing to the general support,
and in turn receiving appropriate sustaining power, must be uniform
throughout the whole. Such a body, thus acting, be it human or corporate,
is alone a healthy and harmoniously constituted power. All
governments, to be able to contribute to the public welfare, must exist
upon general similar principles and act by similar means.</p>

<p class='c008'>It must again be observed that when several parts or powers are
organized into one, no power less than the whole has authority therein;
for, in consenting to the union at first, all absolute individuality is forever
waived; the individual is no longer simply an individual power,
but forms a part of the common power. Nor can absolute individuality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>ever again be maintained, except a superior antagonistic strength is
developed, which demonstrates that the powers originally attempted to
be consolidated were impossible of harmonious action—a natural and
sufficient reason for dissolution. Tested by these propositions, what
conditions and relations does the government of the United States, as
a whole composed of parts, present? Does it form one homogeneous
whole, the paramount interests of the parts of which is the best welfare
of the whole? Does each and every part act in unity and harmony
with every other part, and in turn yield to the preponderant
authority of the whole, with that grace and dignity which bespeak
unison of purpose and interest? If not, where does the difficulty find
its starting point? Is it in the system by which the power was organized—in
the interpretation of it, or in its administration? For this the
Constitution must be referred to to find wherein, if at all, its organization
is defective. If the conferment of power by the organization is
complete, then it must be concluded that those who administer its organic
force either fail to comprehend the extent of its application or to
perform their duty in applying it.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>ANOTHER LETTER FROM VICTORIA C. WOODHULL ON POLITICAL HISTORY.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Article IX.</span> of Amendments to the Constitution declares that
“The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be
construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Art. X.</span>—“The powers not delegated to the United States by the
Constitution, nor prohibited by it, to the States, are reserved to the
States respectively, or to the people.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span><span class='sc'>Section 1</span> of Article IV. of the Constitution says, “Full faith
and credit shall be given in each State to the public acts, records and
judicial proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by
general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts, &amp;c., shall be
proved, and the effect thereof.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sec. 2.</span>—“The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges
and immunities of citizens of the several States.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sec. 8.</span>—“That Congress shall have power to provide for the
general welfare of the United States,” which last is tantamount to saying,
the general welfare of the people as a whole.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seems from these quotations, made in inverse order, that it was
the intention of the framers of the Constitution, to make such provisions
as would permit and compel harmonious action throughout the
States, but that subsequently it became a part of party policy to maintain
that the States had rights reserved, and while not defining what
these rights were, to declare that such as were not distinctly and positively
delegated constituted this reservation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under this interpretation it is possible for serious difficulties to
arise between the general government and the States, as they have. It
seems from the general tenor of the original Constitution that these
amendments are nugatory, because the inference to be drawn from
them is inconsistent therewith. One of the most prominent, as well as
the first declaration, is to the effect that nothing shall exist in any State
injurious to the general welfare of the whole. While it is within the
scope of Congress to determine what is for or against the general welfare
of the whole, no State can set up its rights against such judgment.
When it is further made the duty of the United States to guarantee a
republican form of government to every State, and to protect each
State in such against all others, there can be no limit set upon the general
powers of Congress.</p>

<p class='c008'>The only fault, if fault it may be called, in the original Constitution,
lies in this—that while the power to do is vested in the United
States, it is not made an imperative duty to perform, though the duty
is to be inferred by the vesture of the power. In failing to exercise this
power in its fullest sense and to perform this inferred duty, lies the
cause of all the disturbances within the limits of the country.</p>

<p class='c008'>We can now proceed to the consideration of what duties Congress
is invested with the power to perform, which have not been exercised,
and which, being exercised, would contribute to the general welfare
of the people, and thereby promote the public good. It will also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>be considered whether there are any additional powers Congress should
possess which can be conferred, and which the Constitution neither directly
nor inferentially vests. This consideration will proceed without
regard being given to separating what comes within the limits already
possessed from that which should be conferred.</p>

<p class='c008'>First in importance, because of general application, stand the
common laws of the country. Of these it is asserted, with the utmost
directness and force, that when a general condition is to be provided
for in the country, it should be the sphere of the government to make
the same law applicable everywhere, so that the citizens of the United
States shall, at all times and places within its limits, be subject to the
same controlling and guiding rule. There should be no such possibility
as an Indiana divorce under Indiana law, differing so much from those
of other States as not to be recognizable by them. There should be
only United States divorces, under a general law that could not be
questioned anywhere, and by which the parties to it, should stand in
the same relations to each other, in whatever part of it they might
chance to be, also in such relations to every one, that they may remarry
without becoming liable to the charge of bigamy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Within the last few years, many States have found it necessary
to so reconstruct their general systems of law as to cut off all special
legislation. This course is eminently judicious in every respect it can
be viewed, and has proved excellent in practice, by relieving legislation
and procuring uniformity. If this is a desirable result, so far as a
State is concerned, why should not the application be made general for
the United States, with prospect of proportional benefit? All people
would then be subject to the same rule of action and responsibility.
To illustrate: A State has a general law under which joint stock and
other companies can become incorporate. Before this, each proposed
company was obliged to make direct application to the State government
for an act of incorporation. After it, any proposed organization
could become incorporated by conforming to the regulations prescribed,
and thereby obtain all the power that could be conferred by the Legislature
direct.</p>

<p class='c008'>No one having knowledge of the tedious processes of legislation
will question the advantage of this general law, both as regards legislation
and the people. This admitted, it must be further admitted,
that the advantage would be still greater, were this a general law of
the United States, applying in every State, instead of a mere State
law, with the probabilities that each State having it would provide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>different steps and regulations, so that a person familiar with that of
one State, finds he knows nothing of it in the State he removes to.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same line of reasoning applies with more or less force to
every branch of legislation. Especially is it pointed regarding the
Criminal Code, for here very great distinction exists in the several
States. The penalty for a specified crime is scarcely the same in any
two States; while some have abolished the taking of life for life, others
still imprison for debt, which shows a degree of divergence entirely
incompatible in a country that professes unity of purpose and practice.
In civil practice it is utterly impossible for the most studious and profound
jurist to acquire and retain accurate knowledge of it, in even a
small proportion of the States. Every lawyer can testify to the difficulties
he encounters at every turn when the laws of another State
have any bearing in the case he is engaged upon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some States require that deeds executed in another State for property
within itself, shall be acknowledged before a notary, while
another requires a commissioner of deeds; and still another the certificate
of some Court of Record that the notary is duly appointed, &amp;c.
The difficulties that arise from this condition of things are of such
magnitude as scarcely to be conceived of by those who have never experienced
them; nor can they be adequately presented in the limited
space of this article. It is, however, held to be apparent, that if a
general bankrupt and election law is to be preferred to thirty-seven different
ones, general laws upon all other subjects are also preferable.
It is a logical conclusion that the “public welfare” would be promoted
if Congress should pass general laws for the whole country, to cover
all cases and causes that are general to the whole country, leaving for
the States such legislation only as can have no application outside of
their individual limits.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not surprising that well instructed jurists of foreign countries
have no faith in our existence as a consolidated nation. They argue,
that it is impossible of a country containing so many internal sources
of discord and differences. “A house divided against itself cannot
stand” they hold to equally apply to nations. If this has stood thus
long and prospered, it by no means follows that it will always stand
and prosper; but the inference is, that sectional interests will be the
source of continual disturbances and revolutions, until some great sectional
interest shall become powerful enough to separate itself from the
rest of the country and to defy its power successfully. In view of that
consideration, should not the attention of Congress be called to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>fact that it is its inferred duty, at least, to enact all laws that will promote
the public welfare? And to this end it should inquire how the
public welfare is suffering from the neglect thus far practised, that the
remedy may be applied.</p>

<p class='c008'>If it is found that its power under the Constitution to remedy such
evils is doubtful, amendments granting it should be at once proposed
and submitted. Whatever opposition there might be on the part of
present State Legislatures and officials the people will welcome any
measure looking to the eradication of the cause of internal agitation.
It cannot be that patriotism is to pass away entirely, though it appears
to be nearly submerged by the rising tide of individual selfishness.
Let it arouse itself and consider whether there be not room for exercise
in the direction indicated, and whether it is not better to prevent
disaster than to repair damages. The example of Louis Napoleon is
an excellent one to follow. Nor should patriotism be blinded by the
mere name of freedom and justice, sounded so loudly to cover the deformities
practised under their shelter.</p>

<p class='c008'>In many directions, this is eminently an analytic age. Let the
fruits of government be submitted to the crucible. Many of them
would be found not only hollow, but basely deceptive. It is well
enough to cry peace when war rages, but the crying will not bring it.
It is well enough to laud the freedom of the land, but why not make
the direct inquiry to find how much of it is real, and how much is
fancied freedom, not to say genuine slavery? It is well to assert that
justice holds sway everywhere, but those who have had most occasion
to find it, must hold their peace lest the fair delusion be dispelled.
Let the peace that is cried, the freedom that is lauded and the justice
that is asserted, be subjected to the test of analysis, that it may be
really known what principles enter into their composition. It is much
to be feared that when all the dross and foreign substances are separated,
and the pure residuum only left, its proportion to the mass submitted
would be lamentably small. Still let us have the analysis.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>THE FIFTH PART OF MRS. WOODHULL’S DISQUISITION ON GOVERNMENT—INDIVIDUAL ENTERPRISE AND ITS DEVELOPMENT AS AFFECTED BY GOVERNMENT.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Individual enterprise, especially among Americans, has produced
the most wonderful results. Very much of the advancement
of the country is directly attributable to it. Great minds
have been obliged to operate singly and alone to develop their inspirations,
ideas and conclusions. Thousands possessed of comprehensive
principles in a semi state of application have sunk with them into obscurity
for lack of appreciation and support. In the infancy of the republic,
before it was possible for any to catch the idea of its grand
destiny, it was not to be expected that any great or general system of
interdependence between the government and the people should be
adopted. There was a general fear of everything that did not seem to
promote that individual freedom which seeks no harmony with the
greatest freedom of the whole, while no regard was paid to any philosophic
relations of the individual to the whole number of individuals
represented by the government. This was intellectual individuality,
lacking the harmony of wisdom.</p>

<p class='c008'>It came after a while that the great enterprises demanded by the
rapidly increasing growth of the country could not be conducted by
single individuals, and numbers of them combined to carry them out.
Rapid means of transit began to be developed, which in many instances
redounded to the pecuniary benefit of the company prosecuting them,
but always to the general interest of the whole, both as a people and as
a government. On the contrary, many enterprises which have proved
equally beneficial to the country have ruined those who projected them.
Thus the general welfare has been promoted by the sacrifice of individual
interests. Especially has this been true of the great system of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>railroads that binds the nation together with bonds of iron, too powerful,
it seems, for any sectional interest ever to sever.</p>

<p class='c008'>Internal improvements are eminently a legitimate branch of the
general government. They are not for the benefit of individuals or
sections, but for the benefit of the whole. So true is this that a seemingly
purely local government cannot confine its benefits and
uses to the section it is located in. Its influence permeates the very
extremes of the country. A railroad connecting two cities in the
same State may be built. At first glance this would be declared simply
and only of benefit to the localities it passes through. But upon close
scrutiny a variety of ways develop themselves that must be advantageous
to thousands, residing in all parts of the country, and to the government
itself. It therefore conduces to the public welfare and convenience
in a much more general sense than to sectional or local good. It is
therefore entitled to the protection of the government, whose duty it is
to look after and promote the interests of the public. Is it entitled to
anything more, or does the full duty of the government begin and cease
with simple protection?</p>

<p class='c008'>Continuous railroad connections exist between Maine and California,
between Minnesota and Louisiana, which have been built by private
enterprise, and are still maintained and conducted by combinations
of private enterprise. These, with their connections, form a net work
that penetrates every section of the whole country, all parts of which
system are conducted as nearly as possible, considering the variety of
management, with regard to the harmonious working of the whole as a
general railroad system of the country. The representatives of the several
roads meet and arrange terms of transfer and connection, first, to
accommodate themselves; second, the public which patronizes them
(be it especially remembered that the public welfare is always secondary);
and thus it comes that that which is made the duty of the government
to guard with jealous care is subserved to the interests of a
company of incorporated individuals, whose profits, drained from the
productive interests of the country, amount in many instances to an
enormous per cent per annum upon the original costs of the enterprises
This is not the greatest good to the greatest number. It is the
greatest good to the smallest number at the expense of the greater number.
The public is hoodwinked into the toleration of their extortions
by fictitious arrays of figures, and by the increase of the “watering” of
their capital stock whenever an eight per cent. dividend will not consume
their unexpended balances.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Again, there are railroads of great importance to the general public
whose earnings are not sufficient to make any returns to stockholders,
scarcely sufficient to meet current expenses, and yet the public welfare
would not permit of their discontinuance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same line of policy that controls the postal service should be pursued
by government in regard to railroads. None now think of intrusting
that very important department of the government to private enterprise.
Is the transportation of the public itself of less vital and general
importance than its thoughts and wishes are, that it should be
obliged to rely upon private enterprise to accomplish its welfare, and to
obtain it be subject to its extortions? The custody of transportation
of all kinds by government would insure regularity, harmonious
operation, safety and dispatch, at minimum cost, to all whose pursuits,
interests or comfort, incline or compel them to its use. If the sphere
of government is to be determined upon principle, and it is the true
principle for the government to conduct the postal service, to the end
that the public welfare be subserved, then the same principle determines
that railroads and telegraphs should also be conducted by government
to the same end.</p>

<p class='c008'>The time was, when it was necessary to the general good for the
government to guarantee protection and even assistance to enterprises
that should introduce these improvements into the country. The
country needed them. Government, not understanding its true relations
to the people, failed to provide them. Private enterprise, more
sagacious and more perceptive of the actual demands of the age,
stepped forward, and, taking advantage of governmental supineness,
developed the true greatness of the country. The time has now come,
and the government is in position and understanding, to not only guarantee
all needed internal improvements to the public, but also to take
charge of those already existing, and to conduct them in the interests
of the people.</p>

<p class='c008'>These improvements are not patents that should forever remain
hereditary charges upon the industry of the country. They are granted
privileges, made by the government to promote the public welfare, and
not for the continuous private gain of wealth and power. Let a limitation
be put upon these patented privileges, so that the public good may
be still further promoted. Let government purchase what are already
in operation and construct others, as demanded, and conduct them all
under one grand system, to subserve the interests, necessities and comforts
of the people, which it is its duty to provide for, even if in exceptional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>instances it be at the expense of the public, as in some instances
it is in sparsely populated districts regarding the postal service. Let the
same rule of action that governs this service be applied to telegraphs,
railroads and all improvements that are public in their character. Let
the present owners and conductors of them become the servants of the
government and the people, instead of remaining, as now, their masters,
thus forcing them, by the only possible way, to comply with the
interests and demands of the general welfare.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides, these gradually consolidating interests are becoming too
powerful and selfish to longer allow of the government or the people
regarding them with indifference. Even now they control a deal of
legislation by the power they possess. Unless soon dispossessed of the
means of increasing their power and influence, they will become greater
than the government, and even dangerous to liberty. The national
banks are powerful enough to feel they can dictate to Congress. What
might not a grand consolidation of railroads, representing thousands of
millions of dollars, be able to do, if left to present tendencies? This
is a matter of most serious import, which is tending to a despotism
more intolerable than that exercised by any of the monarchies of the
Old World—the despotism of capital over labor.</p>

<p class='c008'>This despotism is making the productive interests of the country
utterly subservient to the power they have created, fostered and protected,
which should forever remain their servant instead. These improvements
are demanded by all the growing interests of the country
that express themselves through commerce between the several States,
and it is the duty of Congress to “regulate” them. It has the power.
The remedy is required. Let it be applied, and at once, so that the
greatest and most beneficial of all the many systems of internal improvements
any country possesses, both for the country as a whole,
and to the comforts of the people as individuals, may be conducted and
extended in accordance with the interests and demands of the public
welfare. Nor should there be any outcry raised against the purchase
and control of railroads by government, as an unwarrantable interference
with private rights. There are no such things as private rights
when the public good stands in question. If the public good demands
a new street through the most densely populated part of the city, the
property of private citizens is condemned to its use, and damages assessed,
from which the individual has no appeal. The same rule must
apply to all property that the public demands for the promotion of its
interests, telegraphs and railroads not excepted.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>MRS. VICTORIA C. WOODHULL’S CONCLUDING CHAPTER ON THE SCIENCE OF GOVERNMENT</h3>

<p class='c017'>[The following is the concluding chapter of the essay on government,
its aims, sphere and tendencies, by Mrs. Woodhull, the female
candidate for the Presidency:]</p>

<p class='c008'>There are no circumstances existing within the range of government
which are deleterious to the conditions among which they are
found that do not come within the sphere of its control. If it were
attempted to enumerate all such conditions, a very large proportion
existing would come in for mention. Special reference will be made
to such only as are represented by crime, indigence, helplessness and
perverseness. While government has its duty to perform regarding
all these, in their relations to society in general and the public welfare,
it must not be lost sight of that they form a part of the general
public, and, as such part, it has a duty to render even to them and to
the relations they sustain as individuals to other individuals.</p>

<p class='c008'>The criminal is not only the son and brother, but often the husband
and father. Though he may have, by some act, forfeited the
guarantee of liberty government extends to the people, he has not
thereby sundered family relations, responsibilities and duties. It is the
duty of government to foster these, while protecting public welfare by
preventing the criminal from pursuing his course of individual freedom
at the expense of the freedom or happiness of other individuals or the
public. In this view penitentiaries should not be what they are, but
should be changed into vast workshops, where the convicted may labor
at some not altogether distasteful employment, to the same end that he
should labor when free. The theory of punishing crime is not all
that should be taken into consideration regarding the criminal. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>now practiced it is exceedingly doubtful whether the State does not do
the individual greater injustice than he has done the public. The State
should pursue such a course as is perfectly clear from injustice, such
as can conscientiously be held as committing no crime against the
criminal. To render to him what and only what he has rendered
another is maintaining the old Mosaic rule of “an eye for an eye,”
which in these latter times should be obsolete. The world has risen
from the condition of Mosaic times by the experience of thousands of
years. Fear was the only controlling power then. Should it be so
now? Prevention is better than remedy; besides, there is no such
thing as remedy for crime already committed. The criminal can by no
possible means—nor can the State—undo the wrong. Reparation in
most cases is impossible, but should be rendered, wherever possible.
It becomes, then, the chief duty of the State to prevent the recurrence
of wrong by putting such restraint upon those who are inclined to it
as will effectually prevent their inclinations finding expression.</p>

<p class='c008'>Supposing that all living persons who have ever committed any
infringement upon the rights, liberties or privileges of others of sufficient
moment to warrant preventative means being applied were restrained
from mingling with the public, what would be the ratio of
decrease in crime? These persons have trespassed upon the public
welfare and it must be protected from further trespass. It is the duty
of the State to see this done. At the same time the means of prevention
must be such as shall not encroach upon the culpable one’s rights
further than such prevention actually requires. As a member of society
he has forfeited to society, to a certain extent, the freedom of
expressing his privileges and rights as an individual, by the infringement
upon the privileges and rights of another individual, also a member
of the same society; and for this, society is in duty bound to restrain
him. It only requires that the present universally adopted
theory, that crime is against the people and not the individual suffering,
be carried to its legitimate sequences to teach the proper limitation
to this restraint. Having arrived at that, it remains for the State to
concede every other individual privilege to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>It should be his right and privilege to labor and receive its full
recompense, to which the State should have no right, further than the
cost of his maintenance. The profits should be given those dependent
upon him, or should go toward reparation for the damages done by
him. He should have the privilege of amusement, should have access
to a public library and the daily news. His whole restraint should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>made as nearly as possible analagous to the every-day life of a useful
citizen. He should no longer be the condemned criminal, but the
member of society whom the public welfare requires shall be restrained
from following the freedom his proclivities indicate.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is another class of individuals who, either from circumstances
beyond their control, from indolence, from incapacity, from settled
habits or from perverseness, do not perform sufficient labor to maintain
themselves and families in a condition that renders them useful members
of society. Society suffers more or less from all the different representatives
of this class. They must live, and society must, in some
manner, furnish the means to them of living. If it is not earned, it is
begged or stolen. There are those also who, being too honest to steal
and too proud to beg, suffer untold privations. All who would cannot
obtain remunerative occupation, or that which they are suited to perform.
To all of these as members of society, as a part of the people, government
owes a duty. Society, of which they are a part, owes them
the necessities of life, even if it be compelled to force them to earn
them. It cannot be made the duty of individual members of society
to look after the amelioration of these conditions. It is a general condition
growing out of the relations of all its members, and hence becomes
a governmental function, not only so far as they, as a class,
are concerned, but also to protect individuals of other classes from
being made to bear the burdens of them, either by voluntary contributions
or from the impositions of beggary and theft. Every one who
has attained proper age, and is possessed of moderate health, is capable
of performing sufficient service to support him or herself, and by so doing
is a useful member of society, because contributing to the sum total
of its productions. If he cannot obtain employment, society should
supply it to him. If he will not labor, society should compel
him. If he cannot labor, society should maintain him. Were
this practice once instituted, the dens of infamy and vice, the
sink-holes of crime and disgrace, the pest-houses of disease, and the
crammed-to-suffocation attics and cellars of our large cities, would be
emptied of their occupants, and they be made useful, instead of, as
now, iniquitous members of society. They are a dead weight society
has to carry. It is a duty society owes them and itself to compel them
to assist in maintaining its general progress. The same principle that
applies to the criminal should also include them. The general influence
they exert upon society is even worse than that of the downright criminal—for
where the criminal is one they number thousands. If it is necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>for the interests of the people that he who steals a hundred dollars
should be restrained of his liberty—and it is the sphere of government
to do it—how much more would it be for its interests to transpose
these leeches upon the vitality of society into producing members of it?
As a subject wherein the public welfare suffers, it is strictly within the
sphere of government. Other citations of unprofitable members of society
could be made, but sufficient has been alluded to to indicate the
general limits and sphere of government when considered philosophically.
The evidences of a perfect government must not be sought
among the most powerful and useful members of society, but among
the very lowest classes. A good government can have no classes
so low in the scale of development or use as to be detrimental to its
interests. And here is the test of governmental perfectability. If the
United States, as a nation, occupies any superior or conspicuous position
in prophecy which is to make it representative—if it is the point
around which consolidation into universal government is to begin, and
from which control shall revolve until the world is its object—it becomes
the imperative duty of our statesmen and legislators to extend the
sphere of government until its limits are bounded by nothing that is
detrimental to the general welfare of the people. Such government,
and such only, can be enduring while becoming universal.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. I.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Government being an organization of power, and power always
presupposing action, motion, it becomes a matter of the gravest importance
to a people who are formulating a government that they should
lay hold of the highest sources from which action can spring—that is
to say, as all action is the result of some prime motor power, to have
action which will proceed in perfect channels, producing harmonious
motion, it is primarily essential that the motor, or moving or controlling
force, shall be of that character which in expression will move
majestically yet sympathetically against all opposition, always having
in view the fact that the presence of low forms of any development is
detrimental to all higher forms with which they come in contact, either
directly or through exerted influence.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has previously been found that the deductions which are to be
drawn from a complete analysis of all the tendencies which governments
have exhibited during the historic age of the world, conform to
the propositions of the highest form of religious conviction, which is,
that God being the common Father of humanity, that humanity must
be a common brotherhood. Consistent with this the tendencies of government
are found to have ever been to one common form. If these propositions
grow out of the fact that the principle of unity is at all times
operating to bring about a perfect expression of itself, through humanity,
the legitimate deduction is, that the time will come when its ends
will be accomplished, and that that time will be when humanity has
risen into a complete recognition and acceptance of the fact that they
are all children of one common parent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Principles never change. They constitute the basis of creation,
the forms of which are constantly changing under the influence of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>application of the same power. The same force which caused the matter
of which this planet is composed to first assume its orbital position
and motion, now causes the various parts of it to exhibit the almost infinite
variety of manifestation which is now presented. The same
power that was exhibited in the construction of the original rocks, is
also exhibited in the construction of the sweetest, most fragile flower.
The evidence of evolution—progress—being, that from the rocks the
flower has been produced. Ascending to the animal kingdom, motion,
the result of power applied to matter, was found manifesting itself in
the simplest of organic forms. There, as in the previous periods, it
continued its constructive workings, until the perfect animal form, man,
was evolved.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the strictest examination which can be made into the power
which controls, there can be nothing detected which would seem to,
even indicate that there is anything outside of, and superior to
the contained life, to which to attribute the direction the form takes
through which life is manifested. If this be so, the principles which
underlie the physical universe are but names for this inherent power,
which cannot be attributed to any power less than the Source of all
power. Manifested principles of action, then, which relate to matter,
may justly be considered as the perfect operation of divine law through
the physical universe.</p>

<p class='c008'>It becomes resolved to this: that the power which is the compelling
principle of all action is at all times the same, but that it manifests
different results, as the channels through which it operates are different
Thus, the motion of the atmosphere over the surface of the ocean
exhibits power by the waves it produces; while the same power proceeding
to land bends the forests and the fields, verdure before it. The
tiller of the soil involuntarily recognizes this fact, when he destroys all
growths which exhaust the constructive power of the air and soil except
the particular one he desires to further or perfect. He knows that
to concentrate all the power upon this one, he must concentrate its expression
in the form he wishes developed. If this process could be
understood, it should be the ordinary rule in every department of the
universe. All the power there is, should be concentrated into action
through the most advanced, and consequently the most perfect
forms—perfect forms always being those which are adapted to the highest
uses.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wherever this rule is generally applied by nature or man, the
lower existing forms disappear, and in due time the higher fill the places
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>they occupied. Thus, species of plants and animals are constantly disappearing
from the economy of the universe, while new and higher are
as constantly appearing. And it is to be specially observed, that where
the new exists the old dies out. This law is also distinctly visible in
the development of the different races and types of the human, all of
which a universal tendency prophesies will ultimately be merged into
one grand, all-comprehending race. The tendency to this condition
was distinctly traced in the Tendencies of Government, and was
held to be the basis for the conclusion, that, in its continuance, the
condition named would be naturally and inevitably reached. It may
be stated then, as a general rule, that the most certain method there
can be to destroy the bad—the old—and to inaugurate the reign of
the good—the new—is to attend to introducing the good in the most
rapid and best manner, which will naturally live upon and sap the life
from the old, which must necessarily pass away.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a new race of humans is introduced among a race which is
not possessed of that capacity which makes it possible for it to develop
or assimilate to the new, it will most certainly die out. Such races are
fixed types of the human, and their characteristics can never be merged
among the general characteristics of the future common race of humanity.
The North American Indians are good examples of this fixedness,
and they will soon cease to exist upon the face of the earth; while the
Negro is an excellent representative of the capacity of evolution and
also of amalgamation. It is not to be lost sight of, that when the
Anglo-Saxon and the Negro amalgamate, the direction the amalgamation
takes is always from the black to the white, and never from the
white to the black, which is positive evidence that the Negro will ultimately
be entirely lost in the white races.</p>

<p class='c008'>A mighty lesson is also to be gathered from observing the constructive
process of the several kingdoms of the earth, each one of
which is built upon the preceding and leads to the succeeding. The
vegetable kingdom could not exist until the elements comprising the
mineral had gone through their various processes of integration and destruction,
by which vegetable life was made possible. The vegetable,
taking up the process inherited from the mineral, began moving through
the same cycle of advancement by which the mineral had made it
possible, and it gradually merged into the animal; and so gradually
that it can scarcely be decided whether some forms of life belong to the
latter or to the former. The evolution of the animal, having ultimated
in the production of the human, it is not to be inferred that there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>nothing beyond the animal kingdom which is the fruit thereof, as the
vegetable was of the mineral and the animal was of the vegetable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, the vegetable world feeds from the animal—the animal
feeds from the vegetable, which is the only source which furnishes living
protoplasmic food, upon which the animal can alone exist.
Humanity takes this protoplasmic dish either fresh from the vegetable
or second-hand from the animal. It will thus be seen that
everything which nature accomplishes serves specific purposes, and
that when the supply is exhausted the demand ceases. If this principle
is followed to its legitimate end, it will close in the life of the whole
animal kingdom being merged into humanity, which will then feed
entirely from the fresh protoplasmic dishes of the highly developed
fruit of the vegetable kingdom.</p>

<p class='c008'>These arguments are not pursued as a necessary part of the
Principles of Government, but that the working of universal principles
may be caught sight of and made use of in the endeavor which will be
made to decide how humanity can best assist the operations of these
principles as applied in its own government. Nature being ever consistent
in all her movements in the several kingdoms, how shall
“Mind” assist her in accordance with her own principles of operation,
in establishing perfect channels for her powers to produce the perfect
fruit of the animal kingdom?</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Tendencies of Government it was found that all movements
in government which have been made during the historic age of
the world have been in the direction of universal control, the persistence
of which course leads to the conclusion that it will be attained
when government shall be based in those principles which, proceeding
from a common centre, shall be sufficiently potent to control the entire
circumference of humanity. The limits and sphere for such a government
to exercise its power in, was found to properly extend to all
matters in which the common interests of the public are concerned as
against assumed individual interests, which would in reality be to the
“greatest good of the greatest number.”</p>

<p class='c008'>An exemplification of the natural working of a government founded
and administered according to strictest governmental justice may be
seen in the growth and in the maintenance of the life of the tree, which
may be made to represent the tree of humanity. The tree is a complete
community within itself; all its branches and twigs, even to the
extremest distance, are dependent upon the same fountain for its controlling
life currents that the parts nearer the base are. No single
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>branch can maintain its life independent of the rest. Each separate
one must draw its proportion of supplies from the same source and
return the stream to its fountain when its demands upon it are
completed. This power, starting from a common fountain, is delegated
to the various branches for still further and more general distribution;
but no branch can set up a distributing process for itself in
opposition to the general process. If the branches had the power to
set up processes of their own, the inevitable result would be inharmonies
in the common order, which would work ultimate injury to all
parts connected with the main body. Thus it is with a country. It
must possess a common governmental fountain, and all divisions of it
must be directly dependent upon the common fountain. No division
can be permitted to set up special channels of administration for itself.
Each must work in harmony with all others, and all be equally dependent
and dutiful to the common head. In such and in only such
can harmony prevail and life be continuous.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having found, then, what the destiny of government must be, and
having determined its proper limits and sphere for operation, it becomes
still more essential and necessary that the true mainsprings of
governmental power shall be recognized, for without this, government
would still linger in its age of temporary resorts to get over the constantly
arising contingencies of the times. When this recognition takes
place, legislation will have accomplished its work, and the vast talent
therein expended can be turned into the channels of governmental art.
It is to attract the mind to the operation of general principles in nature
that we have thus far dealt with the material universe. In advancing
into the subtler department of mind, it cannot be for a moment supposed
that an entirely new arrangement of principles lies at its base, any
more so than that there should have been new rules of nature to introduce
the animal or the vegetable. Instead of this having been, it
is perfectly demonstrated that the same laws govern in each and all;
that is to say, that the same principles of government control them
all. Bearing this in mind, we now proceed to the consideration of the
operation of principles wherein the human mind comes to assist nature
in its strife for perfection, itself joining in the race.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. II.</h3>

<p class='c011'>It was remarked previously that Nature is consistent in all her
operations throughout her entire domain; to which may now be
added that the nearer the human approximates his rules and methods
to those exhibited in the departments of Nature below him, the nearer
will he approach to true rules and methods. Arbitrary and dogmatic
formulas do not belong to Nature in her free manifestations, nor can
they be administered in any of her combinations. In all the uses men
may make of the elements of matter, he must comply with the laws
of their existence: he cannot frame a law, and then command that Nature
shall obey it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Certain quantities of certain elements will combine and form a
compound; but no other proportions of the same elements will combine
to form the same compound, and in many cases they will not combine
at all, unless certain fixed quantities are adhered to. Again, an
effort may be made to unite two or more bodies, and they will be found
to be incompatibles; that is, incapable of being united, because each has
a stronger self-affinity than for any property existing in either of the
other bodies with which they are brought in contact; but to these two
or more bodies another principle may be added, which will produce the
effect of uniting the whole. It is this principle in nature by which its
elements combine and form all the various and diversified manifestations
that are visible everywhere. These forms are none of them absolutely
independent: they may, by their inherent power, attract other
forms to themselves, or be by others attracted; the more complex and
distinctly individuated ones being dependent upon those from which
they spring for their existence; thus, as was before stated, the animal
world is absolutely dependent upon the vegetable world for the protoplasm
it must make use of to replace that expended by the animal
economy. No animal can take the elements protoplasm is composed
of and manufacture it; that process is alone the office of the vegetable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>world. And thus it is that a complete and infinite system of dependence
exists from the lowest form of organic life to the highest; each is
necessary to every other, while every one fills a special individual position
of its own, and this is because they are all bound together by the
same controlling powers or principles of action.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is readily seen that the principles referred to are the same that are
expressed by a common humanity, a universal brotherhood: one is a
brotherhood of the elements; the other is a brotherhood of the ultimates
of elements, of which mind is a product. Each kingdom has its
beginning and culmination, and by the observation of their evolution
we must draw the deductions as to what really governs that age of the
world, and the special kingdom we find ourselves living in. The beginning
of the mineral kingdom was when simple elements began to unite
to form compounds; which was when the cooling process had so
far progressed as to allow of combination; this process of the uniting
and dispersing of elements culminated in the production of the simplest
vegetable life, and thus ushered in the vegetable kingdom. In this,
again the same process of uniting and dispersing was gone through with
that had characterized the mineral. It began as it did, and culminated
as it did by producing the next higher, or the animal kingdom,
the simplest form of which is a single unit of nucleated protoplasm.
Upon this single unit the animal kingdom began to be built. The same
process of integration and disintegration continued through countless
ages and until a form was produced, which is the ultimate of form in
the animal kingdom. This ultimate, man, is the perfection of form
that protoplasm can produce, and hence is the grand ultimate of the
process of elemental combination first referred to. No other or higher
form is possible to be arranged from the elements that the earth is composed
of. Therefore, all future advancement to perfection must be in
the perfecting process in man, and therefore it is logical to conclude
that the same law that governed the beginning, the evolution and the
ultimation of each of the kingdoms that produced man, will also govern
the beginning, the evolution and the ultimation of the different
stages in the perfecting process in him; and not only in the perfecting
process as a whole, but in each division of the perfecting process; and
this brings us to that part of the process illustrated by government, and
to the principles of government which are under consideration.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be observed that there is a perfect analogy in the process
of evolution that is observed below man, and in that which comes of
man. First, there was the elementary unit, which corresponds to what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>was the governmental unit—the family government. Next, and second,
there was the vegetable division, which corresponds to the second
order of government—the consolidation of families into tribes. Third,
there was the animal division of the process, which corresponds to the
amalgamation of tribes into nations. Fourth, there was man, the ultimate
of the whole process, containing in him the elementary principles
represented by all the preceding forms—in none of which were
they all represented as they are represented in him—and he corresponds
to the ultimate of the process of governmental evolution, the
complete consolidation of nations into one grand nation, as man is the
complete consolidation of all animal forms in one grand animal form.
His form is the animal form, containing all animal forms. A universal
government would be a national form, containing the form of all
nations gathered into one grand form. Here it is that the analogy is
complete, and Nature is consistent in all her parts and processes, at all
times and in all forms observing the simple general principles which
so unerringly lead her.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is, however, one important addition to the processes in
which man takes part, over those where principles apply only in the
so-called material control. Below man there is nature only. After
man there is art added to nature; and it is this power to administer to
Nature’s processes, to assist in them, and to remove and replace obstacles
to activity in higher channels, that distinguishes man from all previous
formations, and which virtually makes him an assistant in the after
and higher evolutions of mind, which have, until very recently, been
generally considered not of material origin, but which science now demonstrates
are purely physical results—are combinations in consciousness
of consecutive manifestations of matter. Here we have the ultimate
production of the ultimate of the animal kingdom, the mental
kingdom, or the kingdom of ideas.</p>

<p class='c008'>Science also demonstrates that ideas evolve after the same formula
which all preceding processes observed, and that all new discoveries
of ideas are not discoveries of existing facts, but that they are
new truths evolved from preceding forms of truth; or, in other words,
that they are higher forms of truth.</p>

<p class='c008'>These relations are thus specifically stated, because in them is
found the authority for man to make use of all things which exist, that
by such use, higher purposes may be subserved and better general conditions
obtained. As the gardener destroys all weeds and foreign
growths about the vegetables he would produce, so must the gardener
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>in ideas pull up, eradicate or destroy, all false or decaying ideas which
sap the vitality from those he would have flourish; and this authority
is the same—the authority of the higher over the lower, to the extent
of individual freedom and within the limits of the general good.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such is the province of art, and man, in whatever department of
nature he operates, is the artist, adding to her beauties, which she can
produce by her laws, those which the evolution of higher ideas proposes.
Thus art utilizes and beautifies all that nature produces. Nature alone
could never produce a Central Park, nor the perfection in fruits and
flowers that is now presented to please the taste and gladden the eye.
No one will question the right of man to make from nature the most
of beauty it is capable of, nor to make it most conducive to all his
natural desires. And here is found the basis for the authority from
which it is analogically argued, that man has the right to practice as an
artist in ideas. The position this artist in ideas should be assigned
should be as much higher in the scale of importance as ideas are higher
than crude matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Government being the most formidable director of ideas and the
most powerful opponent of their diffusion, if they are not in channels it
can operate through, its perfectability according to the highest existing
ideas is a matter of the most fearful importance. It is for this reason
that so great importance attaches to the diffusion among the people of
knowledge of the principles government should be constructed upon
that its administration may be productive of the greatest individual,
and the greatest public good, which it is possible to obtain from the application
of the highest evolved ideas.</p>

    <div>THE PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. III</h3>

<p class='c011'>It has been the intention to show the importance of unity of purpose
in government, and that such unity of purpose can only be obtained
by the application to administration of those principles which
in operation produce unity in the kingdoms below the kingdom of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>ideas. Human government differs from all other kinds of government
in this, that it is for the control of Mind instead of Matter. The
natural direction the individual would pursue results not only from
causes which arise in his material nature, but to these are superadded
those which pertain to the Mental in contradistinction to Matter.
Each individual is not only an epitome of all previous material forms
which have been evolved, but he is also the finite representative of the
Infinite Power which caused all those evolutions, and therefore has
an individualized, determining power of his own to the extent that
he represents the Infinite; and as this extent differs in degree so extensively
among the total of individuals over whom government presides,
it is the most difficult of all tasks to prescribe forms for it to
operate through, by which it can reach and control this diversity.</p>

<p class='c008'>This most serious difficulty which arises at every step in the
search for the true source of government, comes from the innate sentiment
of freedom in man, which is the truthful expression of the characteristics
of the Infinite, which are indigenous, so to speak, to his
nature. He involuntarily resists all attempts to exercise authority
over him because of these sentiments. He feels, he realizes, that no
individual, nor any number of individuals, has any authority from any
competent authority to exercise supreme control over him; and thus it
is that all individuals resist control.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just at the point arrived at comes in the other part of the fact,
which being considered, modifies the absoluteness of individuality.
Every individual must either ever remember, or be compelled to remember,
that he is but one of millions of individuals who live upon
the face of the earth, each one of whom feels the same innate sentiment
of self-right; and thus it comes that there should be no restraint at all
over each individual exercising all his selfish ideas of rights strictly
within his individual sphere; and that all these should be compelled to
harmonize so that none may interfere with others. Even to this last
proposition there are natural modifications to be inferred from everything
below man. The higher order has the authority of its position in
the natural scale of evolution, over all that precedes it; and this
authority is of that absolute character which receives the sanction of
nature in all the kingdoms which man can view.</p>

<p class='c008'>The higher orders of ideas and thoughts should thus be the controlling
power among men. They should assume the business of the
artist in ideas, and prune, dig and destroy, if possible, all lower ideas
which, live but to sap the vitality from the more advanced. The best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>expression, then, which it is possible for principles to find in the individualized
productions of the highest animal form, must be sought in
the most highly developed mentality; or in that mentality which expresses
the most of the Infinite, and which is consequently the highest
authority represented through humanity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mentality represents the most important department of the duality
which constitutes the source of governmental power; but this, acting
alone, would not prove the perfect principle. It would pursue its aims
with no regard to sentiment or feeling. It would ruthlessly destroy
all imperfections which debarred it from having absolute control, instead
of endeavoring to consolidate their life with the higher and the better
because it is the higher. To this active, sternly analytic principle,
must be added the principle of unity or the affectional, which seeks to
combine all mentality in one harmony. The head and the heart should
act in concert; the head perceiving that the same general principles
should be used to direct the forms of every department of life, and endeavoring
to apply them to control humanity, should head the appeals
of the heart, which, from its mainsprings of love and tenderness, feels,
that the whole universe is bound together by the indissoluble ties of
fraternity, and, therefore, should realize that as a father and mother,
they should govern their children. Of these principles, government
should be the true exponent, representative and administrator.</p>

<p class='c008'>But here the question arises: How shall such government be inaugurated?
How shall those who are the best representatives of advanced
ideas and the broadest fraternal feeling become installed as the
administrators of government? Every thinking person knows that no
such persons or principles are in authority now, and that they have not
been these many years. In the early days of the republic, which was
constructed by men whose souls were imbued with these principles—or
at least the fraternal principle—it may be fair to admit that something
nearly assimilating to the true kind of government did exist. A
government founded in the principles ours was could not have been
organized except by men of the very highest order of development in
the true principles of government. They were hundreds of years in
advance of the general people, for whom they wrought, and it may be
seriously questioned whether they have had any representatives since,
and whether they have any at present, who are actuated by any such
lofty patriotism as they were. So long as they lived it was but natural
that the people should have continued them at the head of what they
had constructed, by the means they prepared for the expression of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>their right of self-government. It is well demonstrated that these men
fully realized the principles of freedom, equality and justice, which
realization comes from the conspicuous development of the paternal
and affectional elements. Mentality, it is plain, was not so conspicuously
developed, for they did not comprehend that the time would
come in which those who should fill their places should be almost infinitely
lower in the scale of true governmental principles than they
were, or that the controlling motives of such could ever descend from
their lofty stand to grovel in the purely selfish. But the time has come
and now is, in the which the present places the fathers of the republic
occupied are filled by those who are not in any sense the representatives
of the true principles of government. It is quite true that the
people are responsible for the men they select to represent them, but
that does not better the very bad fact that the people are not represented,
any more than that the true principles of government are.
When this fact is seriously considered, it becomes apparent that there
is a difficulty somewhere in the processes of government which has such
imperfections that the ends of government as understood by its founders
are utterly defeated. The result of this imperfection is, that instead
of the true and best representative men of the country—those
whom the previous analysis points out as possessed of the qualities
demanded in government—being chosen to perform the function for
which they are adapted, they are left one side, while others without
ideas are sent where they should go. In short, the whole governmental
operations have been and are being prostituted to the selfish ambitions
of party leaders, who do not care a whit what means are used so
that they win thereby. This shows not only that there are imperfections
in the organization, but that there is much which is radically
wrong. It is even now being more than whispered around that there
is a plot being matured by which some of those who are now in power
intend to continue themselves in power, even if they are obliged to
seize upon the government in spite of the people. Such a plot could
only bring destruction upon the actors; but that such a disgraceful
thing could occur, or even be conceived, proves that a remedy is needed
somewhere, which shall prevent such persons acquiring the power
they would thus prostitute to their own purposes, at the expense of the
sacrifice of the rights of the people.</p>

<p class='c008'>This government is either a government for the people or for the
office holders; latter practices incline outside observers to the opinion
that it is the people’s only in theory. If we examine the theory, it looks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>finely enough; but when the manner it is outwrought comes under
observance, nothing can be found which entitles it to the name of the
people’s government. It is not the people’s government by a very
great deal; nor is it a government for one-half the people even;
neither is it a government which guarantees equality to its citizens;
every count which can be made is against it, as the exponent of principles
upon which it professes to stand.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the first instance, one-half of the people are debarred from all
political rights whatever, and they are those who form the producing
part of humanity, and whose interests in government are in every way
equal to that of those who exercise all the political power. Thus at
the very outset we find a professed equal government proscribing one-half
the people over whom its authority is exercised; and, be it ever
remembered, is fully maintained. While they are made responsible
for all infringement of law, they have no voice in determining what that
law shall be. While they are compelled to assist equally with the
preferred class to maintain and support government by the payment
of taxes, revenues, &amp;c., they have no power to control the use that
shall be made of them. This proscribed class, though living in the
United States of America, a so-called Republic, are in no better condition
and stand in no superior relation to the government they are
compelled to give adhesion, respect and support to, than are those of
the most absolute monarchy upon the face of the earth. What think
you, enslaved people, of the great, the free, the exalted government of
a country which professes so much and grants you nothing?</p>

<p class='c008'>In the next instance, it is not the government of the one-half of
the people it has really the semblance of being, and which many
think it is. To completely establish this significant fact, the attention
of the people is called to the immense minorities in the several
States, and the relations which they sustain to a Presidential election,
wherein the sum total of all the citizens of all the States
who are permitted to cast their ballots, and who do so cast their
ballots, for the electors who vote for the defeated candidate, exceed the
sum total of all the citizens of all the States who are permitted to cast
their ballots and who do so cast their ballots for the electors who vote
for and elect their candidate. Such results have obtained; but a President
thus elected is elected by the votes of the minority of the citizens
of the United States who are permitted to vote, and consequently, within
the Union as a whole, a person may occupy the Presidential chair
against the will of the majority of the voting citizens of all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>States. Such is the perfection of the forms which have been framed
and used through which to obtain popular self-government; and such
the results obtained.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same line of argument applies with equal directness and force
to the citizens of each State in relation to their entire State government,
with the exception of such officers as are elected upon the
ticket with the Governor; their representation in the lower House of
Congress, and in their Legislatures and through their Legislators and their
representation in the Senate of the United States may be, and often is,
that of the minority of the voting citizens of the State. The same is
also true of all incorporated cities outside of their general officers.</p>

<p class='c008'>This condition of affairs shows that there are two conflicting principles
ever operating against each other, and that their very worst features
appear when their object is the “first office in the gift of the
people,” which, above all others, should be filled by the choice of the
majority of all the citizens of all the States.</p>

<p class='c008'>Scarcely less in importance, as compared with the Chief Magistracy
of the Union, is the importance of Congressional legislation,
which should be determined by Representatives and Senators who
should represent the majority of all the voting citizens of all the
States. This government will always stand in danger of being overthrown
by the unrepresented majority, so long as such forms of arriving
at representation are allowed to determine these questions, which
lie at the very basis of a republican form of government.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole difficulty which this question presents arises from the
seeming stubbornness with which the people refuse to understand that
the interests of the people as a whole can only be promoted by promoting
the interests of each individual composing the whole. In this
consideration the Democratic doctrine of States rights, to which the
Democrats adhere even yet with so much apparent stubbornness, is utterly
subversive of the first principles of unity and it may be emphatically
stated that until enlightenment is obtained upon this point by the
common ignorance of the country, there is no security from wars such
as that from the effects of which we have not yet fully recovered. The
same principle of States rights, as compared with those of all the States,
if a correct principle of self-government, should also be recognized as
the proper one to be acted upon in counties as against the State, and in
cities as against counties and States, and in wards as against cities, and
by citizens as against the wards in which they reside, and by the several
partners of firms as against the authority of the firm as a whole.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>It is the only mischievous principle which is operating to destroy the
Republic which is prophetic of so much civilization and advancement
to the whole world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under the application of such principle a single government for
all the “nations, kindred and tongues” of the earth would be utterly
impossible and impracticable. Nothing but strife, contention and wars
would follow a government founded on such principles of individuality
as do not and will not recognize the superiority of the community as
compared to the individual members of it. Upon this principle brought
down to individuals, every individual would have the absolute right
to act upon his own self-interests, no matter how seriously such action
might interfere with others possessing the same right. The community
would have no right to compel any restraints upon the individual under
this principle of rule. This principle applied everywhere would
carry us back to pre-historic times, when every individual was his own
supreme authority, and maintained it at the risk of his life. This is
the purest form of anarchy, and as such is laid down by all writers
upon pre-historic times.</p>

<p class='c008'>Why do not the advocates of States rights contend for the application
of the same principle to its fullest extent, and thereby become
consistent? Why do they advocate any general government at all?
The truth and the facts of the case are, that such doctrines as recognize
the rights of the individual as superior to the rights of the community in
which he resides, are subversive of the first principles of order. Suppose
such principles governed the entire sidereal and solar systems,
what chance among so many vast planets would our little earth have?
<i>It is saved from destruction because there is a Prime Power which compels
them all into harmony of action and movement, whatever courses their
individual proclivities would lead them to.</i> The application of this general
superior controlling power in governmental affairs is the only
method which can secure—because it will compel—harmony.</p>

    <div>THE PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT.</div>

</div>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. IV.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Notwithstanding all this, which has been said in opposition to the
doctrine of individual sovereignty as the true principle of government,
it contains the germ of an ultimate truth, which will be realized when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>the total of individuals forming the world’s community shall have become
so advanced from the present low conditions to those of wisdom
and love, as to make every individual involuntarily recognize the rights
of every other individual. In other words, individual sovereignty will
be the principle of government when that time shall come wherein
there will be no necessity for government, because the people shall have
grown into the condition of a universal brotherhood. It is this innate
sense of individual right which is present in the consciousness of every
individual who has grown to know he is an individual, which makes
this constant conflict between ultimation and approximation. It is the
expression, politically, of the same principle which, religiously expressed,
makes it possible for the consciousness of the individual to
contain an undefinable knowledge of a Great First Cause, and at the
same time to feel that he is an individual agent. In other words, it is
the old doctrine of free agency reproduced in the political world, which,
if it is but considered a single moment with an unprejudiced mind, it
must be seen that there is no such thing as free agency; for every individual
is dependent upon something, over which he has no control,
every instant of his whole life, which something even produces the
capacity which gives him the power to think he is free.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be seen, then, that the great general principles which govern
the entire universe, are recognized in the proposition that all people
are born free and equal, and entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness, which are inalienable rights; but it fails to be comprehended
that the inalienable rights of freedom are limited by the other condition
of equality, which makes every individual free within the distinct sphere
of his individuality, but not free within the sphere of other individuals.
He has the inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,
when it is not exercised at the expense of the inalienable rights of
others in the same direction. These are the governing laws which the
worlds obey, and which control the minutest particles of matter. And
these are the true “Principles of Government.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be also seen that the forms by which the principles of our
government are administered are imperfect, and consequently that, however
much we may reverence the Constitution of the United States, it
requires remodeling to enable the true principles of government to find
expression through it. The inconsistencies, also, of the rights of States,
as represented by the common government, must also be removed. The
State is either the source of governmental power or it must proceed
from all the States, as combined in government. If the former, we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>no more to be respected as a Union than the numerous Italian and German
States were before the consolidation. The republic, under such
construction, amounts to nothing more or less than a union for offensive
and defensive purposes, <i>at the option</i> of the several States, which is
as purely a governmental force as could well be imagined. The inconsistency
of this construction of the Constitution was fully shown in No.
III. of the “Limits and Sphere of Government,” and need not be repeated
here; the subject has been pursued here, that the utter folly, inconsistency
and impossibility of the recognition of individual rights,
where such rights conflict with the community as a whole, might be
the more palpably apparent. Having considered the source of the imperfections
which exist in the form of our government, what should
legitimately follow for consideration is, the remedy. In the first place,
the theory of States rights must be abandoned, and each State must
become a member of the Union by organizing under a common form,
to be prescribed by them all, or by the present required constitutional
majority of them all, to make an amendment to the Constitution valid.
The same rule should be applied as that which has come to be a recognized
necessity in States regarding incorporating companies. All the
States should be required to organize under a general State law, which
should be clearly and concisely set forth in the Constitution, which
should recognize the general government as the determining power,
and not that it exists by the sufferance of the States, but that the States
exist as organic bodies, because they have complied with the requirements
of the Constitution, which was necessary to constitute them
States. In conformity with such acquired power, States should prescribe
the means by which cities can become incorporated. In this
way, unity of purpose and harmony of interest can be secured from the
individual up to the total of individuals forming the nation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such a government would be a strong government indeed, but one
in which its composing members of States and the composing members
of individuals would have the utmost extent of freedom that the interests
of the whole would admit. If this is not the end to be gained by
government, then government is a simple farce, and unworthy of being
allowed to exist anywhere. From the earliest historic ages the world
has constantly been extending to individuals through its forms of government,
more and wider freedom and greater privileges and immunities.
This process will continue to spread, as the general people become
more and better fitted to be the recipients and the appreciators of
such extensions to them.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>The individual has more rights and privileges to-day in the world
than at any other previous time, but all individuals have not yet become
such perfect laws to themselves that no formulated law is required to
restrain them from the infraction of others’ present rights, privileges
and immunities. Until such time come, a strong central government is
required.</p>

<p class='c008'>A strong central government does not necessarily mean anything approaching
a monarchy. But it does mean a republic which will have the
support of all its citizens as a central support, instead of each State comprising
the Union reserving to itself the right to differ from the central
power. In such a government, the majority of the people would, at
any time, have the right to elect new officers, as provided for, so that
the strong central power would not be in the individuals administering
the government, but in the organic law which constitutes the several
parts of the country a common government, which, while being the
strongest possible governmental form, it would, at the same time guarantee
the greatest possible freedom, equality and justice to its people
which would be compatible with the common interests and the common
good.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lastly, such a central power of government is the only one to
which peoples not already within the government could be admitted
without endangering its existence. A new State desires to become associated
with the several States forming the present Union. Immediately
she is admitted, she has, under the present doctrine and practice,
the right to withdraw. She has been admitted by and with the consent
of the required majority of the States previously constituting the
Union; therefore, logically, she has not the right to withdraw without
the same consent It required this consent added to her free and self-expressed
desire to become a State; it should also require the same
consent before she should be allowed to withdraw from the Union.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under a general rule for the admission of new States, and of
allowing addition to the present limits of the Union, all that would be
required would be for the people of a certain limit to adopt the requirements
of the Constitution, and present themselves to Congress for admission.
Aggregation, according to this rule, could always proceed
without ever endangering the safety of the general government, because
a country once having become a part of the Union would be under
the mighty constraint of the whole Union to properly and peacefully
perform the functions of a State in the Union. This condition can be
well illustrated, by supposing that there was a confederation of all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>European powers to preserve peace among themselves under certain
defined agreements. If a single power violated any of those agreements,
or attempted to make war upon its own account against another
nation, a party to the agreement, all the other contracting powers
would be in honor bound to make the interest of the nation against
which proceedings were being had contrary to the common agreement
their own. War, under such conditions, would be practically impossible.
So would disunion, under the proposed system of confederation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The country which shall first adopt such a system will be the
centre of the future Universal Government of the world; and it is with
this view in mind that these suggestions are offered to the people of
the United States of America, which country is, by the common order of
the universe, appointed to be that centre, to the end that they shall see
the necessity of immediate action to perfect the organic laws of the
country.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. I.</h3>

<p class='c011'>It is a mistaken notion that the interests of labor and capital are
in any way antagonistic to each other. This fallacy has, however,
taken such hold of the minds of the representatives of both
these interests, that it is engendering a spirit of bitterness which,
it is to be feared, will grow into as fierce a character as that against
slavery did. It is always hard to produce any argument that will convince
this spirit If convinced, the spirit of opposition will not be
calmed, and obstinacy, assuming the place of all sentiment, compels the
individual to remain rebellious.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is most true that there could be no capital unless labor
first existed. This stamps labor as of the greater importance. Let a
person be cast upon a fertile island, without pecuniary means, and he
will live by labor from its fertility; but let him fall upon an utterly
barren and sterile land, and all the millions of a Rothschild would not
insure his existence. So it is everywhere, and under all circumstances,
to a greater or less extent. Labor can exist—though not flourish—without
capital; but capital cannot exist entirely divorced from labor.
Being dependent upon it for primary existence, it must ever remain
under a direct analysis in the state of semi-importance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The capitalist is the more unreasonable of the two in the position
he assumes. He continues to apply all his energies to the acquisition
of wealth, utterly regardless, in most cases, of any idea of justice to
what has given it to him. The general practice is—and this is the true
test, for whatever is of general application must be governed by some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>underlying principle of right—when capital requires any given thing
done which it is obliged to apply to labor to accomplish, it must give
one-half interest in the venture to enlist its co-operation. This is true
regarding nearly all speculative pursuits, and when there is an actual
necessity for either to apply to the other for aid to carry out its desires,
this rule of agreement always obtains. This forms one of the most
conclusive arguments by which to demonstrate the true relations of
labor and capital, and should be made the basis of all co-operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not for the best interests of the wealthy to become still more
so at the expense of poverty to those under them. On the contrary, it is
their true interest to render fullest justice and strictest equality to the
demands of labor, to be determined by the principles that shall promote
the most general good. It is the greatest mistake of the age—it
has been the greatest mistake of all ages—to suppose that individual
benefit must accrue from the acquisition of wealth at the expense or
sacrifice of any general principle of justice. It is also a great mistake
for labor to array itself in opposition to wealth, and to form combinations
to control it. It is too late in the ages for these kinds of arguments
to convince. They can only end in producing still more injustice
and distance between the two interests, which distance will be filled
by rankling bitterness and contemptuous insinuation. An approach of
the two interests is what is desired—an assimilation of them, so that the
same end shall be best for each.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be laid down as an unanswerable proposition that there can
be no general happiness, peace or comfort among a people so long as
the principles society is built upon tend to promote unequal distributions
of the products of labor; and this brings us to the consideration
of the remedy. It is to reconstruct society upon such principles as shall
tend to promote complete unity, harmony and equality among its various
classes. To accomplish this it should be the special aim of every
one possessed of wisdom enough to comprehend a common logical proposition
to endeavor to bring about this equality by diffusing the deductions
of it, in all possible ways, among both classes. Let the various
producing and exchanging classes exist as they do, but let their relations
be governed by such rule of law as shall render them equal, both
as to caste and to the benefits to be derived from an equal interest
in the common cause of the brotherhood of mankind.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. II.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The strife that is being urged to create divergence between the
interests of these bases of society is purely the result of ignorance of
the first principles of constructive use on the part of their representatives.
Instead of an endeavor to demonstrate to the understanding of
all, the true principles which underlie these interests, which would
effectually unite them, those who have selfish personal ends in view seek
to further them, by engendering a spirit of bitterness and a desire for
strife. There are those who cherish the ideas of aristocracy who have
no wealth, on the one hand, and are too indolent to endeavor to attain their
desires by active labor, on the other, who think to create some serious
diversion, and upon it to ride into place and power. This class of individuals
are ever busy stirring the coals of dissatisfaction into flames of
rebellion, thinking thereby to become the acknowledged representatives
of the labor interest. It is generally true that a cause supported by such
means has no principles upon which to base its claims; but in this instance
the most absolute and just principles are ignored, while cant and
bombast usurp their proper sphere.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is quite true that there is a growing tendency to centralize capital,
and that consolidation of monetary interests is the rule; but the
fault of this does not lie in capital or capitalists—it is farther back
than it or they. It is in the people themselves, and in the fundamental
principles upon which society is built, and those which the people allow
government to be administered upon. If the laws of a country
permit the doing of a certain thing, which it is for the interests of a
certain few to do, and they chose to avail themselves of it, there are
many to be found in these times so much governed by the desire for
the public welfare as to take the advantage offered them by the people,
for it comes down to that at last. The labor class have it in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>power to send to Congress just those who shall fully represent their interests;
but they do not do this; most of them are found actively supporting
those whom Capital selects and holds up for their suffrages. The
remedy lies with the people, and they must make use of it before they
can ever expect to see their rights adjusted.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is, as was said above, no conflict between Capital and Labor.
The conflict is among their representatives. On the contrary, there is
an entire harmony of interests between them. The true interests of
each are best promoted by rendering justice, full and complete, to the
other, and in the understanding of this lies the <i>only</i> solution of the
Labor Question. Strife may continue, war, even, may come of the
strife, but finally the settlement must be made upon the principles of
justice, which underlie their relations. One comes from the existence
of the other; this, when created, should ever acknowledge its paternity,
and never assert supremacy, nor be allowed to do so; to be so allowed
shows that defects exist in the fundamental principles of government,
or in its application to existing things. These defects it should be the
duty of those who prate with so much volubility to discover and proclaim,
to the end that they may be understood by the people. The
people in turn should send as their representatives to frame laws, such
persons as shall make it their business to attend to their duties rather
than those who allow themselves to become immersed in the schemes
of plotting politicians who seek eternally to continue themselves in
place and power, and who lose all sight of, or care for, their constituency,
in their necessarily continuous efforts to secure that end. Such
representatives should be religiously ostracized by the common people,
and none tolerated but such as understand the relations which the interests
they wish fostered bear to those they feel they are becoming
subjected to, and who will unflinchingly advocate them at all
proper times and in all proper places. The durability of government
rests upon the entire harmony of all the interests it is framed to protect,
and no country can ever become continuously prosperous that has
within it the elements of discord; no country can endure for any length
of time that does not seek to eradicate all causes of dissatisfaction, and
to so adjust its interdependencies that they shall be mutual and just to
each as individuals, and to all as the public.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. III.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The duty of the philanthropist is to point out the harmony of
interests that exists between the extremes of the different grades that
society consists of. There are a certain class of would-be reformers,
who make it their business to stir up strife and contention between
these grades, and thus to separate their interests, and to make it appear
that they are antagonistic. The number of the latter class as compared
with the former, gives them a preponderant influence, which, added to
the real grievances existing, enables them to create considerable excitement
and much imagined wrong, which has no foundation in fact.</p>

<p class='c008'>The laboring classes, being occupied by their labor, do not devote
much time to the study of the circumstances that control their condition.
They see that other classes fatten from their productions, and
without stopping to inquire why it is so, straightway conclude that they
are the subjects of an oppressive power which desires to completely
wrest the results of their labor from them, and to always keep them
in the condition of virtual vassalage. This conclusion rouses the spirit
of independence in the laborer, and he determines to redress his
wrongs. He sets about forming combinations, having in view the control
of wages and hours, not comprehending that the remedy lies deeper
than these, or that these would regulate themselves, could the true
cause of the condition they rebel against be reached and generally understood.
While it is true that capital can never enslave labor to a degree
that can be considered compulsory on the part of capital, and unnecessary
on the part of labor, it is equally true that labor cannot compel
capital to its commands. Therefore both these methods of cure
should be abandoned, and preventive means be resorted to instead.
And these it is our duty to point out.</p>

<p class='c008'>The judicious architect, before pulling down the old structure,
provides the material to replace it; in other words, he substitutes the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>new for the old, and in the process leaves no unnecessary interval in
which the fostered interests shall be left to the vicissitudes of anarchy.
It is evident from the rapidly spreading knowledge among the laboring
classes, that they will soon demand some modifications in the forms, and
in the relations they sustain through them to society. Before breaking
down the present organizations society exists in, by revolution, which
would end in a period of anarchy, out of which better conditions <i>might</i>
grow, the better conditions should be first considered, prepared and determined
upon, and, by being thoroughly understood, should be substituted
for the present by general consent, without society being compelled
to pass through the anarchical period that succeeds all violent
disruptions of present forms, whether in government, religion or society.</p>

<p class='c008'>As society is constructed at present, it must look to legislation to
produce forms and to enforce order through them, that society may observe
in their operations the better results to them. Society expresses
itself most powerfully through legislation. Public opinion is a force
capable of many things, but is powerless to redress grievances or to institute
the new and better for the old and decayed, unless it is directed
by the formula of law. All the energies of labor reform, then, should
be directed to the main point, from which benefit to itself must spring.
It should waste no time nor strength upon the minor issues, but concentrate
all upon the one strategic point. And when this concentration
is effected, it should not fritter away its strength by dealing with
the contingencies of the present, or in small expedients, to enable us to
dodge along, simply escaping shipwreck, to be again forced the next
day, week or year, to the same expedients to escape similar shoals. Instead,
it should direct all its capacities to substitute a new and better
foundation, upon which a new and better superstructure of society can
be reared. How shall such a work be begun?</p>

<p class='c008'>Legislation is the primary constructive point from which better
conditions must emanate. The laboring classes, then, must see to it
that they are properly represented in legislation. Nor should they be
deceived into the support of any who, by bluster and tongue, loudly
proclaim themselves the champions of labor, without the understanding
of the first principles that control the relations of labor to capital. Let
it be set down, once for all time, that he who denounces capital as the
oppressor is not the representative labor should choose to right its
wrongs. In every community there are some who think a great deal
and say little; these, as a general thing, are the antipodes of those who
say a great deal and think little. Though the last are usually found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>floating about the surface of society, it is to the first, society must look
for that wisdom, judgment and executive ability that shall guide it to
the desired harbor.</p>

<p class='c008'>It should be the first duty of the labor interest, in each State or
national district, to select and elect one from that class that has calmly
observed the workings of present systems, and who can show where
the cause of existing ills lies. It is to the philosopher, and not to the
politician, that the labor interest must turn its eyes, and though he be
not smooth of tongue and glib of speech, he will lay such a foundation
in law as will produce the conditions desired. Your present representatives,
State and national, have shown themselves incompetent to
the task you demand of them. Leave them to seek their level, and
turn you to others, who will not lose sight of your interests in the allurements
which place and power present. You cannot expect that
those who are not of you can appreciate your wants or understand
your conditions. Choose from among yourselves and you will not go
far astray. There are, however, noble exceptions to this rule of decision.
There are those who were reared in wealth whose hearts sympathize
with you, and who feel quite as keenly as you do the injustice
you suffer. In these you will find your best advocates, but see to it
that your suffrages are never, once again, worse than withheld.</p>

<p class='c008'>You are in the majority, and the fault is your own if you do not
make use of the power you possess. Nominate and elect your own
men; if your first choice fails you, try again, and continue trying, until
the right man for the position is found; and when found, while
holding him strictly accountable, give him your cordial support while
he is true to your interests. Most persons who occupy position now,
feel compelled to yield principle to the demands of policy, in order to
retain it. This must be remedied. None are fit to hold position who
will sacrifice one iota of their conviction in order to retain it. Self-interest
must be surrendered to those whose power fills the place, and
for the time being it must act as the representative of them and not as
its own. It cannot be too strongly insisted upon, nor too often repeated,
that it is the first duty of the labor interest to look to it that
our halls of legislation are filled by those who understand the true and
the harmonious relations of labor and capital.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. IV.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In our last the attempt was made to show how important the
laborer should consider the choice of representatives to be, and also
what class of persons should be chosen. The task of making these selections
cannot be begun too soon. In every district in the Union the
laborers should be made alive to this question. Some who fully appreciate
its importance should take it upon themselves to begin the work;
they should converse with the few they come in contact with, and these,
becoming interested, should be induced to extend the agitation; and
finally, all over the country, primary labor meetings would come to be
held for the full and complete discussion of the whole subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is the most complete evidence of supineness on the part of the
laboring classes that they are not now represented as they should be.
Being so vastly in the majority, every office should be filled by them.
The difficulty has been—and we fear will be—that while the laborer
has been busy at his regular task, others have managed the incipient
stages that produce the candidates, in such a manner that the interests
of the majority have been entirely ignored. Finally, when the regular
party ticket is presented, the least objectionable one receives the support;
and thus it comes that the real interests and wishes of the people
are seldom represented, and as seldom is the elected candidate the real
choice of the people.</p>

<p class='c008'>Unless our laboring classes arouse themselves to the real importance
of this matter, and become willing to devote sufficient time to preparing
their candidates, they should cease blaming others for results;
for they now complain of things they have it in their power to remedy,
but which they cannot expect others, whose interests seem to be at
variance with theirs, to correct for them. Those who declaim so loudly
and profusely about the wrongs labor suffers at the instance of capital,
should be strictly guarded against, lest they, unwittingly, become your
leaders and advisers.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>There are at all times numbers of persons standing waiting and
ready to step forward to take advantage of any favorable movement
among the people which seems to offer inducements. It matters not
to them in what, or where the movement may originate; they have no
principles to crush out or control in order that they may fall into the
current. It is almost impossible to escape the curse of these ever-ready
tools. The safest and surest remedy against them is to select
those who have never mingled in politics, and who will come direct
from the shop or the field. It does not matter so much if they
are not able advocates, if they only understand the work to be done
and are devoted and true. Let this course be pursued a few years,
and the enormous proportion of lawyer-legislators would be diminished
by one-half. Many of these have no sympathies in common with you,
most of them are, by all their controlling influences, drawn from the
consideration even of your condition. What does it matter to them if
the few articles you must purchase to render yourselves and families
comfortable, cost you ten, twenty or fifty per cent. more than the
actual cost of their production, if corporations for which they are attorneys
become still more corpulent upon this that is indirectly filched from
you! For, do you not know that capital under such rule does not pay
the taxes of the country, but that your labor does? In this way, the
common laborer, who should not be compelled to pay any levy at all,
is taxed on almost everything he eats, drinks and wears, and thus labor
is compelled not only to produce what makes wealth possible, but also
to sustain it after having produced it. This is a vast inequality in favor
of capital and against labor, and still it is the laborer’s fault; and it lies
just where we pointed, in the selection of proper candidates as representatives,
State and national.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are but a very few newspapers that do not <i>profess</i> to be the
advocates of the rights of labor. Let them be called upon to take hold
of this matter, and take hold of it at just that point where the remedy
must be applied. Let them lay before the people a plain exposition of
the matter, and certainly aim to make the people understand it. Let
them urge the people to assemble and concert plans and devise means
to carry them out, and to warn them to no longer intrust the most vital
parts of the “necessary course” to the care of hereditary members of
the caucus, whom money buys or whisky controls. It has become proverbial
that he who would be elected to any important position must dispense
both these “powers” with a lavish hand; and he who can do this
the most profusely is pretty sure to “be elected.” You may rest perfectly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>assured that if he spend ten thousand dollars to secure his election
by your votes, he intends at least to double his venture during his
official term. You should know by this time that “the purity of the
ballot box” is simply a “play upon words,” and that elections are but
farces to approve what is previously determined.</p>

<p class='c008'>The people, then, must look on every side for treachery to their
interests and dishonesty of purpose, not forgetting that a large portion
of the press that profess your interests so warmly, that you almost
know their truth, are open to the influence of at least one of the abovementioned
powers, and that to go counter to the <i>commands</i> of those who
“back them” is to go to certain destruction. Nevertheless, demand of
the press a course that cannot be denominated hypocritical, and if it
does not respond, withdraw your patronage, and give it where it will
contribute to your interests.</p>

<p class='c008'>These introductory details cannot be dwelt upon too long nor insisted
upon too earnestly. To begin a work right, is to have it half
accomplished; and most powerfully does this apply in the matter of
determining who shall be your representatives.</p>

    <div>PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. V.</h3>

<p class='c011'>One of the great questions of the day, if not the greatest, is the true
relations that should exist between labor and capital. It is one fraught
with more direct benefit to a greater number of people than any other
question has even the external appearance of being. The real merits
of the question are of much greater significance than is generally supposed,
even by those who raise it. The welfare and the individual
rights of three-fourths of the people are at stake. The question assumes
this shape: Labor has, by its continuous efforts, produced a certain
amount of wealth, from the use of the materials nature presents, that has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>not been required to support and sustain the general life of man. By certain
advantages, either of general policy or of individual acuteness, certain
individuals have accumulated more than their necessities demanded
they should expend, and this accumulation has become an added power
to that possessed by the individual previously, which power endeavors
to maintain itself partly at the expense of that which first produced it,
and to transfer just so much of the cost of its production from itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>That such conditions can exist and really increase in power and importance,
so that they can virtually control legislation, gives evidence
that principles are operative that do not promote the interests of the
entire people. There must be a fault somewhere, which fault it is necessary
to discover and expose, and then remedy. Now, where does
this fault really have beginning? It is in certain protections and guarantees
that law extends to individuals, which permit them to have an
advantage over those with whom they sustain the relations of society.
These laws arise out of false conceptions of the principles of common
equality and economy, which pertain to man as a common fraternity.
In legislation, which first allows and then fosters such departures, then,
must the point at which reform should begin be sought. Any attempt
to teach the general mind can have no practical effect, unless, finally,
the result of the teachings express themselves through legislation.
Legislation presupposes legislators, and to have the right kind of legislators
involves the necessity of the laboring classes giving sufficient time
and attention to the matter of nominations and elections to insure that
those who will represent their true interests shall be returned.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although the remedy for all the laborer’s ills must be sought
through legislation, there are, nevertheless, many fallacies still received,
even by the laborer, that have the direct tendency to degrade labor
and to elevate the position of capital. One of the principal of these is a
false monetary basis, a false representative standard of values, which is
arbitrarily imposed upon the people, with no positive and absolute value
within itself, except that which such arbitrary law gives it. Gold, as a
standard of values, has been set up and worshiped so long, that people
submit to its decrees with about the same appreciation of its real merits
that they have of the mysteries of religion, as expounded by their paid
oracles, who have constituted themselves into authorities to declare,
“Thus saith the Lord.” The people have surrendered their reason in
these matters to these self-constituted authorities, and so have they surrendered
common sense to the god of value.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Another, and almost as important fallacy, is that of interfering with
the natural ebb and flow of the products of the world by imposing upon
certain of them such tribute as makes it pretty nearly impracticable for
them to find their way to the locality of natural demand, in order that
a special few who inhabit that locality may produce the same at a
greatly increased cost, which the consumer must pay in order to obtain.
It does not matter how this plain statement may be twisted and bent
by the alluring sophistries and glittering generalities of the protectionist;
a plain statement, viewed with clear light, needs no authoritative sanction
to determine its truth. If it be any benefit for a thousand men to
pay one man ten per cent more for a desired article, because it is of
home production, than it could be purchased for from a foreign producer,
we should be most happy to have it demonstrated. The argument
used is, that by that one man being protected in its production he
is thereby enabled to give employment to a certain number of laborers.
But to make even this tenable upon their own statement, they must at
the same time prove that those laborers would not have been able to
apply themselves to any other labor during the time required to produce
the article in question. This at once leads to such an intricacy of cause
and effect that those who attempt to solve the mysticism prefer to accept
the declaration that protection is a good thing rather than acknowledge
that they are lost in the fog and obscurity they have been sent to explore
to find the required evidence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another extensive popular fallacy is that of the continuation of
special protection to monopolies after their existence as monopolies is
assured, which renders them perpetual taxes upon the labor that must
make use of them, and perpetual patents upon the industry of the country,
by which a few already plethoric capitalists become still more obese.
The great systems of internal improvements of the country belong to
the country, and the country should so arrange their conduct that the
people could make use of them at the least possible expense of support.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is these and sundry like matters that the laborers of the country
should require their representatives to understand and act upon, and
they should cast their vote for no one that will not, at all times and
under all circumstances, advocate and vote for the greatest good of the
greatest number. In this way, labor may hope to arise from its present
position of degradation to sit side by side with capital in all public and
profitable positions and those of honor and trust.</p>

    <div>PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.</div>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. VI.</h3>

<p class='c011'>From various sources we learn that there is beginning to be a manifest
interest in all the different States and Congressional districts regarding
the next elections. The representatives of labor seem to begin to realize
the great importance of special attention to all that belongs to primary organization,
and to perceive that heretofore they have been obliged to
throw their strength away or waste it in unprofitable directions, from the
very fact that they did not give the necessary attention to the first steps
in the process of determining who should be set up for them to choose
between. It does not seem possible that any should be returned to
office who entertain opinions antagonistic to the general interests of
labor. Three-fourths of the entire population of the country are in this
interest, and whether they be artisans in mechanics or nature—whether
they be by the anvil or the plow—whether they be printers or writers—their
interests are all the same; it only requires that they should all
understand this to consolidate them into a power that would control
every movement of government. Should this unity once be found practical,
and should it be recognized by capital as consummated, its representatives
would be compelled to come to those, who now look to them,
for the granting of ameliorating conditions. It is most probable that
when such a unity shall be attained both the capitalist and the laborer
will, for the first time, discover that whatever really militates against the
true interests of one, is equally antagonistic to the best interests of the
other.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some who have thought this might be so, have endeavored to devise
methods by which harmonious action could be secured. Various
schemes of co-operation have been suggested, many of them tried and
found faulty and then discarded, until it has come to be pretty thoroughly
understood that there is no level upon which they can meet and
part in mutuality of interest. It is true that no perfect method can be
suggested or instituted that will from the first give complete results; but
the principle must be sought that governs the relations between the separate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>interests and applied, at first, with imperfect results, which must
afterward be improved as the interests grow into a true comprehension
of each other’s character.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principle is this, that labor and capital are equally interested
in the productions that flow from their joint operations; that is, the capital
that gives employment to one hundred laborers is entitled to an
equal interest with the laborers in what is produced. But here is an inequality
to begin with. The capital may only represent one individual,
while the laborers are one hundred; still, this is the relation, and the
final result of its operation will be a complete equality in this wise: The
one hundred laborers perform their regular duties, receiving therefor
such regular wages as are proper; and also their respective proportions
of the profits of their productions. In, say, five years, these one hundred
laborers will have accumulated a sufficient capital with which to transact
the business on their own account; and here is where a system of
equality is reached, which again would be followed by another degree
of progress for the laborer. The capitalist, finding himself left out of
the count by the operation of this method, would come forward and
offer his capital to labor organizations at a reasonable rate of interest,
and in this way a common interest would be the only possible result.
The entire profits of the labor would then be divided among the producers,
while the capitalist would have to be satisfied with the moderate
interest he would realize, in place of the extraordinary sums now sometimes
acquired from the sweat and muscle of the laborer. There is one
point, however, in the first instance, that modifies the inequality mentioned
in a very material degree. The capitalist, while enjoying as
much profit as all the laborers, is also liable for all losses, in which the
laborer has no interest.</p>

<p class='c008'>Following the results of the co-operation above mentioned would
be various modifications in society and in the locality of populations.
People engaged in the same pursuits would naturally gravitate to each
other and into distinct localities, while the various interests they represented
would gravitate to those localities that should offer the most inducement
to their respective trades. One of the results of this would
be that all raw material would, in all cases—where all the requirements
were present—be manufactured in the locality of its production, thereby
saving vast amounts of transportation; and this again would be illustrative
of another department of general economy, in the light of which
protection to special manufacturing interests would be seen in its true
colors.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>We have thus briefly endeavored to point out the practical results
that would flow from the adoption, generally, of the true principle of
co-operation for the specific purpose of assisting the labor interest in selecting
candidates for their representatives, both State and national.
They should be those who understand these relations, and what would
naturally follow them, and who would at all times, and under all circumstances,
advocate their adoption, and, in the first instance, such policies
as would most materially assist in their development, and lead to
their introduction and practice on the part of all who compose both interests.
Labor is the basis upon which all society rests, and nothing is
entitled to so much consideration at the hands of legislation. Nothing
heretofore has been so grossly neglected, insulted and imposed upon.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. VII.<br /> PRIORITY OF RIGHT—THEIR POSITION IN THE PROCESSES OF SOCIETY—THE EARTH BELONGS TO MAN AT LARGE—INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, PURE ASSUMPTION—PRINCIPLES, PRACTICE, REMEDIES AND CURE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Capital, primarily, is the product of labor, but labor, in the abstract,
could produce nothing of itself. It must have something upon which to
apply itself. It cannot create anything; it can only alter, readjust or
rearrange the materials which nature offers, and by bringing them into
new relations with each other make it possible for them to subserve
other and better purposes than when, in the constitution assigned them
by the operation of natural laws, they are unmodified by the touch of
mind. Therefore, while capital is the direct result of labor, labor would
not be possible without the free gifts of nature. Absolute originality,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>then, or absolute priority of right, as between labor and capital, cannot
be claimed by or for either.</p>

<p class='c008'>The formula of the operation, beginning with nature and ending
in the ultimate use of its productions, in contributing to the happiness
of the race, is this: Nature is made up of the elements of the universe,
which, compounded into forms, are offered to man to be modified
into other forms and to combine in new relations which may best contribute
to the needs of the human family. In this view, and in view
of the inharmonious relations that exist between capital and its co-equal
labor, it becomes necessary to give the whole matter a complete analysis,
in order to discover, if possible, where the primary fault lies, and to
find the proper solution of all differences.</p>

<p class='c008'>The human race exists upon the earth. At a past period no human
being existed upon it. At a later day the human race arose. Before
man, nothing claimed the ownership of any part of the earth’s surface.
When man presented himself he began to make use of various
parts of it for his own ends, but to the land thus appropriated he acquired
no permanent title or right of ownership. It was his to obtain
from it all that his genius and strength made possible. So much as he
could thus extract he could possess, but further than this his title was
valueless.</p>

<p class='c008'>The races of men that now inhabit the earth are scattered over the
greater part of its surface, drawing what it spontaneously yields and
what they can force it to yield. From these premises it would seem
unquestionable that each individual of the human family had an equal
right to its benefits. The only difference that ought to exist should be
that limited and bounded by the capacity of each to produce. No person
could therefore ever acquire, under the rule of universal justice, an
absolute ownership to any part or portion of the earth’s surface. If the
chain of title to any claimed ownership is followed backward sufficiently,
it will be found to have originated in an assumption in the first instance
of ownership to something that belonged to men in common.</p>

<p class='c008'>We can now acquire landed property from the government, and
this creates the most absolute ownership that can exist; but here again
comes the question whether governments can do what is impossible to
individuals? Can a system organized by a people perform acts not in
the power of the people themselves to perform? Can a government by
the mere fact of having been organized to preserve harmony among a
people acquire an absolute title to the earth that is contained within its
jurisdiction? If an individual cannot go into an unclaimed territory and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>take absolute possession of a certain portion of it, then no number of
persons, nor can any government they may establish, do so. And here
exists one cause of discord between labor which produces and capital
which monopolizes.</p>

<p class='c008'>All monopolies arise from landed monopolies. Were there no inequalities
between men in claims to certain areas of the earth’s surface,
no other monopolies would find a basis for existence. Every individual
should have a right to the use of a certain quantity of the real estate
of the country, and the right to all improvements he might make upon
it. Here would be a basis of equity which would forever prevent the
accumulation in the hands of any few persons, of vast quantities of real
estate, which is the real basis of all securities. It is such a basis because
everything is produced from it. All manufacturers must rely upon it
for their raw material, and, therefore, a practical equality in the occupation
and use of the public domain would insure a certain degree of
equality in all things that might spring from it. It was the perception
of this principle that caused Lycurgus to divide the lands of Lacedemon
equally among all the people; and a general recognition of it
should now take place.</p>

<p class='c008'>While these are the principles that underlie the workings of society,
and which must be practiced before a general equality can exist, it
is not to be expected that they can be immediately introduced. There
are too few who understand the real rights of man, and too many who
do not wish to understand them. While this condition of ignorance
and perverseness keeps the world inharmonious and subjected to suffering,
we should avail ourselves of all the alleviatory methods that can
be suggested in our present system. Between two evils choose the
least; but in the pursuit of remedies, the root of the disease should
never be lost sight of. Nor should the spirit that is exhibited in many
so-called Labor and Workingmen’s Journals be encouraged. Strife and
animosity will never accomplish half so much as calmness, reason and
persuasion. “Come, let us reason together,” was never more judiciously
proposed than it could now be by capitalists and workingmen. The
latter must remember that they cannot compel capitalists to their terms,
and capitalists must not forget that if there are real causes of dissatisfaction
growing out of injustice, the sooner justice is done the less serious
will be the reckoning with the laborer. Instead of strife let us
have co-operation; instead of war let us have peace; instead of the
process of fermentation let us have that of mutual understanding.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. VIII.<br /> THE CINCINNATI CONVENTION—NEW PARTIES AND NEW ISSUES—PEOPLE’S EYES OPEN—DETERMINATION TO TAKE MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS—WILL THEY MAKE JUDICIOUS MOVEMENTS?—THE RIGHTS OF LABOR—SHALL THEY BE IGNORED?—OUR POSITION REGARDING THE LABOR MOVEMENT.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The National Labor Convention lately held in Cincinnati was
called for the special purpose of beginning an organization having in
view the next Presidential canvass. It had taken the means of obtaining
the views of a number of the most prominent public men, letters
enunciating which views were duly presented before the convention.
That of Governor Geary, of Pennsylvania, appears to have occupied
the position of most prominency, and to have been regarded with peculiar
and unanimous favor. The views presented by him are such as
were sure to find favor with the representatives of labor, and so far he
stands A No. 1 as the prospective candidate for the Presidency of the
National Labor party.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been very evident for the last year that the old parties had
lost their power of inspiration over the people. The Democratic party
sold itself out to slavery and virtually died when slavery died. A
party may exist called Democratic, but it will be upon new issues and
must take new departures. The hard conservatism that attaches to it
from its former practices does not suit the spirit of the eighth decade of
the nineteenth century. The rank and file that have so long blindly
followed wherever their leaders commanded are becoming imbued with
this spirit, and they begin to realize that they have been mere automatons
that have been moved with no acquiescent will of their own.
Newspapers have become too commonly read. That the blind should
be led necessitates the continuous condition of blindness. So, too, with,
the understanding. What have the masses known of the essence of the
issues that have formed the platform of the political parties for the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>fifty years? When war came, as the result of a blind course on the part of
politicians, the masses began to open their eyes to the fact that they had
been unwittingly betrayed into a most dangerous and fearful condition,
wherein it became necessary to cut each other’s throats. Since the close
of the war they have not only kept their eyes open to the full extent
the war opened them, but they have also opened their understanding
and for the first time fully realize that they are indeed freemen; and to
become conscious that heretofore they have been so only in name.
Awaking as they have from the delusion so long hugged to their
hearts, it will not be strange if they do some inconsiderate and short-sighted
things.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is the duty of all who have the true interest of the whole people
at heart to warn them of all the extremes they are likely to contend
for, and to suggest permanent practical methods, which shall spring from
principles that will apply at all times to all men—and women. The
Republican party being composed of somewhat different elements is
disintegrated from different action of the same causes; with the destruction
of slavery and the reconstruction of the country its strength was
expended. All people who were opposed to slavery had concentrated
in the Republican party, because of the similarity of sentiment upon
this single question; this settled, they find themselves without a common
rallying idea; they differ as widely upon the old and common
topics among themselves as they differ from those who do not belong to
the party and never did. Place and power are the sole things that hold
the Republican party together at all; these gone it will be gone.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is just at this time that new parties are demanded, and they are
sure to arise. The conditions are all favorable. It remains for wise
counsels to prevail in the formation and departure of these, to insure
them something more than death with the accomplishment of one of
their central ideas, which destiny fell to the lot of the Republican party.
Unquestionably there will be a Labor party in the next canvass. We
are sorry it is denominated the Labor party, because it should be something
more than a Labor party, and because this is a direct challenge to
capital, and it will very probably result in arraying these two interests in
an antagonism which will be but a repetition of the slavery antagonism.
No party built upon a specific idea, looking in a single direction, can
ever attain to even the promise of permanency; and it is for this reason
we say we are sorry to see a party sectionalizing itself at the very outset
of its attempting a general movement toward organization.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>It seems, also, a little premature that an organization calling itself
a Labor organization, should at the outset put itself upon the record
against the freedom of labor, let it come from whence it may, and be
of whatever nature it may. This policy is short-sighted, and will prove
a stumbling-block to the party, though for the time Chinese emigration
may serve for a rallying-cry. All assertions that the Chinese emigrants
can be reduced to a system of slavery among us are humbuggery
of the first water. There is no law to prevent a person contracting
with a hundred American workmen at the best terms he can. It is
quite certain there is no law to prevent him from employing Irishmen,
Germans or even Chinese upon the same terms. And if it is done, and
labor is thereby obtained cheaper than the citizens of this country desire
to furnish it, the laboring class must not lay the charge to the capitalist
who accomplishes it, but to the imperfections of our social and financial
systems which make such resorts possible. Then, instead of committing
this new national organization against any form of legal labor, its
managers should have proposed remedies for the existing imperfections
in our systems.</p>

<p class='c008'>We are no special advocate of the introduction of Chinese or any
other labor into this country; neither are we desirous of advocating any
policy that will conflict with the interests of any laborer, but we are advocates,
and always expect to be, of justice and equity to all people
everywhere, because the time has come in the ages when we must begin
to remember that we are all brothers under the sun, and that he or she
who does not recognize and act upon this universal truth will, sooner or
later, be obliged to learn it at the cost of dear experience. We expect
to be found advocating very many of the principles laid down in the
platform of the Labor party, and could wish that we may find nothing
there adverse to the principles which are of general application. We
desire to see the Labor interest advanced to the right and position of
equality with capital, and we shall put forth our best endeavors to assist
in this most just movement. At the same time we shall not commit
ourselves to sustain or advocate anything that we conceive will be ultimately
injurious to the true interests of humanity, or any part of it,
therefore we shall at all times point out what we regard as errors in
whatsoever this new party may endeavor to carry out. At the same
time we shall, perhaps, be among its firmest and truest advocates.
The best friends are those who show us our faults and sustain us in the
right.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. IX.</h3>

<p class='c011'>This question forms one of the corner-stones of future society, but
of all the questions in which society seems interested it is the worst understood.
Four-fifths of the people of the world toil on, year after
year, and all the time see the other fifth revelling in the luxuries the
sweat of their brows has produced. While the one-fifth enjoy the luxuries
thus produced, as though they had acquired them by divine right,
which none may call in question nor dispute, the great power of the
laboring many has never been felt. It has never been concentrated or
organized into concert of action. Even now this immense force is still
dispersed. It seems to have no centre around which it can gather. It
has no organization, and herein lies its weakness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Organization should be effected for two principal ends: First, for
construction; second, for destruction. The old systems cumber the
ground whereon the new must be reared, and they must be pulled down
to give it room; nevertheless, the constructive part of the operation
must first begin; before the old will yield, the new must at least be
formulated. This is not impossible in the department of principles.
This new rests upon foundations deeper down than existing things, and
these can, therefore, be used previously to the destruction of the foundations
of the old. The new also reaches higher than the old; hence
its frame-work may be reared, while yet the old stand comparatively
intact. The work of construction once begun, that of destruction must
necessarily immediately follow, and when the former shall have been
completed the latter will have been but finished. This is the philosophy
of Integration and of Disintegration in all departments of the universe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Labor and Capital is a question relating in the first instance to the
material prosperity of a people; but secondarily it reacts upon all other
interests—intellectual, moral, physical and religious. None of
these interests can flourish among a people who are burdened by material
wants; neither are they usually unitedly prosperous among that
part of a people who are greatly advanced in material possessions.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Either extreme in material interests appears to be deleterious to the
best and most harmonious general advancement of all the other interests.
It is the mean between the extremes—the calling up from those
below, and the leveling down of those above the mean—in which the
harmony of all is found.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harmony of all the interests of humanity can alone be attained
through organization. A permanent basis of organization can only be
discovered by scientific investigation. The organization of society
must be realized through the science of sociology, which, of all sciences
is the least understood by the general mind. Yet there are among
the great minds of the planet a large number of those who thoroughly
comprehend this science, and it is to these that the world must look
for a reconstruction of its society upon such principles as shall render
it permanent; upon such, as it can constantly be improved upon, without
changing its methods of operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Into such a reconstruction the branch of sociology that relates to
production and use, or labor and capital, will enter largely, and must
be the portion of it to be first entered upon, because all things which
are built upon earth must have a material foundation until there shall
be such a harmony and unity of interests, and such co-operation among
mankind as would proceed from a universal brotherhood, in which
each would have his special part to perform to contribute to the common
result.</p>

<p class='c008'>The agitation that is beginning to be felt all over the world where
intelligent labor exists, indicates that the time is at hand wherein the
first steps toward a constructive organization of society, upon scientific
principles, is to be begun. Not only is this agitation shown to exist in
this country, but it has lately been developed that labor societies exist
throughout Europe, having a common head and centre, and that they
deem themselves strong enough to express wishes entirely antagonistic
to the ruling powers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now what these organizations require to become—something more
than mere instruments for agitation, mere means by which the injustice
between labor and capital is exposed—is to become constructive in their
action; instead of expending all their means and strength in the work
of pulling down the old systems of things, they should begin the actual
construction of a new system. For this end they must bring science—the
science of sociology—to their aid, and make its professors active
leaders and trusted assistants in the grand work. Capital is putting
forth some strong efforts to confine science in its interests, but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>teachings of science are of too general and cosmopolitan a character to
permit its professors to ally themselves with a pseudo aristocracy—the
aristocracy of wealth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Well may the political parties view with alarm the beginning of
organization among the classes they have until now relied upon to
carry themselves into power. If bereft of the capacity to influence the
masses who heretofore have not thought for themselves, they know their
power will depart. How has it been possible thus long for leaders to
control the masses, except that the masses have permitted others to act
for them, and that without rendering any account for such action? The
time for such representation has passed. The people have arrived at
that degree of understanding of their actual interests, that will not admit
of a blind acquiescence in all that even a “People’s Congress”
may do. They will begin to instruct their representatives instead of
being led by them.</p>

<p class='c008'>’Tis true that by capital coming to the rescue of the country it is
intact to-day; but it asked its price and has been paid. So far the obligation
is removed, and justice to all is demanded. Legislation entirely
in the interests of capital will not be any longer tacitly acknowledged
as binding those whose interests are sacrificed. Whatever obligations
the country may be under to those who hold its securities, it is
under still greater to the producing interest, to which it must look for
the ability to retire them when called upon so to do by the tenor of the
contract they contain. It thus appears that all the interests and all the
prosperity of the country are dependent upon the producing classes,
and therefore to them government must listen, for they will not be ignored
much longer.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. X.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Production lies at the basis of all progress. Material production
precedes all other kinds of acquirement. In the first degrees of social
evolution, labor was merely to obtain the means of bodily sustenance
and comfort; from this the present has widely departed; while the future must still further widen the distance between production as an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>end and production as the means to some end beyond. Production in
early times meant simple muscular toil; it still means this, but also a
great deal more; the proper direction of power makes it possible for a
given amount of force to accomplish a greatly increased result. In
the next century make proportionate rapid advancement in the better
adaptation of means to ends than last made over the preceding,
the direct application of muscular exertion to accomplish a material
purpose will be almost unknown. Steam and water have relieved
muscle of nearly all its most laborious occupations and increased the
capacity of production a thousand fold.</p>

<p class='c008'>The reduction of these powers to the uses of man will be supplemented
by that of still more subtle and powerful agents to the same
end, and this reduction will be followed by a proportionate relief to
manual labor. The results of this advancement in the discovery of the
means of reducing the elements of nature to the service of man, is
to be revolutionary to the present grades and distinctions between the
laborer and the capitalist—unless a proper understanding and application
of the science of society first perform that inevitable result—which
will guarantee to all individuals the possibility of like attainment
in all things.</p>

<p class='c008'>Science equalizes everything that comes within its sphere. Let
the great scientist be never so destitute of material wealth, he is still
the great man sought for and honored by those who have nothing but
material wealth to recommend them. Any person may incidentally
become wealthy in material possessions, but none but the devoted
student of nature can become rich in mind; and, none but the devoted
philanthropist can become rich in heart and soul. Even those who
have immense earthly possessions, show their consciousness of inferiority
by courting the great in other fields of acquirement. This
alone should teach all people that true greatness is not to be gained
through riches, and that these should only be considered advantageous
as the means by which to acquire other greater riches and blessings.</p>

<p class='c008'>The true uses of wealth are to advance the peoples of earth from
the conditions in which they are to higher and better conditions, to
those where caste and distinctions shall not be measured by it, but by
the good that is accomplished by its use, in which he will be considered
the greatest man and the most honored, who shall make the best uses
of material wealth in benefiting humanity as a common brotherhood.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has become too late in the ages for individuals to think of living
for themselves, or even for those immediately connected with them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Mutuality of interest is spreading from family interests to world-wide
interests, and the greatest minds of the present are those which perceive
and act upon this fact. The leavening power of assimilation is rapidly
at work among the nations, races and peoples of the earth. The electric
telegraph makes it possible for all the different nations of the earth
to be possessed of the same thought at the same time. For the last two
months the minds of the whole world have been turned toward France,
where the real contest of the future has but just begun. It is impossible
for this concentration of mind upon one centre to be productive
of anything but a growing likeness among those who are the subjects
of it. All the discoveries in all departments of life tend to the same
unification of thought and interest. In this unification is contained the
prophecy of what the future shall be when no individual, family, nation
or race, shall feel that they can live entirely for themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lesson the present movers in labor reforms have to learn is
that of harmonizing the interests of labor and capital by the demonstrations
of science. Springing from a common source and tending toward
a common end, humanity must learn to progress on its course according
to rule, to law and the requirements of order. These sustain the harmonies
of the universe, and should be never-failing authorities for
humanity to pattern after. Those who achieve the greatest conquests
are they who can bring themselves into harmony with the principles
that govern the movements of the innumerable worlds, no two of
which are ever known to disastrously cross each other’s path.</p>

<p class='c008'>The world is capable of producing luxuriousness for all its children.
It is their fault that all do not have it. A very large proportion
of the capacity of humanity for production is diverted from natural
occupations by the illegitimate relations existing in society. A part
live off of the vitality of the rest; the principal object of the part being
to see how much of the fruits of the rest they can aggregate, either by
personal capacity, trickery or cunning, or by ingenious devices of law
formed and administered in their interests. A perfect equality and an
equal justice condemns all such distributions of the fruits of the earth.
If capacity for acquisition exist among a part of the people, government
should interfere to stop its being practiced at the expense of
others.</p>

<p class='c008'>We are aware that this kind of social rule will be repudiated as
an infringement upon individual freedom of action. In this connection,
however, it must ever be remembered that the individual can never be
greater than the community of which he forms a part; in other words,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>the interests of the community must always be superior to those of the
individual, and when individual interests conflict with the interest of
the community they must yield to the community. This principle is
recognized in very many things in government; for instance, the public
demands a common highway which must interfere with the rights
and interests of individuals; the individuals are compelled to give
way for the public, from whose adjudgment there is no appeal. To
this rule of action all the relations of society must sooner or later become
subject, and the sooner it is reduced to this scientific determining
power, the quicker society will have begun a progress whose course
need never be deviated from.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. XI.</h3>

<p class='c011'>One of “our Fundamental Propositions” is the ultimate analysis
of the perfected results of harmonious relations between labor and its
reward. It is not laid down in any spirit of mere speculation, but as a
mark which the human family is capable of attaining, and one to which
it should aspire. Neither is it at all impossible with some of the
present representatives of the race; but it is a natural and legitimate
condition for society when it shall have become sufficiently “grown” to
be possible of organization.</p>

<p class='c008'>Organization is the first step to be made toward reaching such conditions
as the proposition indicate. Simple individual exertion can
never be constructive of society. Neither can the exertions of a great
number of individuals become constructive unless their action is combined
or organized in one direction and for the same purpose. Agitation
must always precede organization, and hence it is that nearly all
primary movements are simply destructive or disintegrating to existing
conditions. A perfect system of society cannot be organized to conta
in
those who are under any condition of servitude other than is rendered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>by the collective number to the law or rule they shall formulate, to control
these relations. A perfect system of freedom is one of the first essentials,
and this must be regulated by an exact justice, as between a
community of brothers and sisters. No ignoring of any part of the community,
whether male or female, can exist The organization must recognize
each and every member of the community, and they in turn
must also recognize the organization which becomes the rule of government.</p>

<p class='c008'>No one will attempt to deny but that there is sufficient capital or
wealth in the world to enable every one to live in a palace; neither
would any deny that the conditions of humanity would be very much
improved could such a leveling down and such a leveling up, as this
equalization would require, be attained. This cannot result from
any arbitrary rule of force, but must be the result of the operation of
the proper principles of law in the relations of society. It must emanate
from a consciousness within society itself of the justice of such principles
therefore the mind of society must be imbued with these principles;
and to do this is the business of those who understand the
science of society. It has been denied that there is a science of
society. The recognition now that there is such a science, and the
fact that the evolution of society thus far has been formulated under it,
is a vast step toward a general recognition of it. When once it is generally
received as one of the demonstrated sciences, there will be various
attempts in all directions to organize upon its not yet demonstrated principles.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who have followed these articles will begin to see that the
attainment of great wealth will not constitute one of the principal aims
of the society of the future. It will only be considered as a means to
other and higher ends. It has not been until quite recently that the
fact of continuous life has been any more than <i>theoretically</i> received.
The practices of mankind have been just such, and only such, as would
obtain, were there no life after physical death, and they have lived as
though the whole of this life should be devoted to purely material ends,
to the gratification of physical desires, and to comforts and pleasures
arising from material possessions. Since the conviction has been stealing
into the minds of humanity that life is continuous, that death is
simply a change of the conditions of life, and that the best wealth that
can be accumulated in the material life is that kind that will make the
best capital to begin the next with, there is a marked change in the
community at large.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>It is beginning to be realized that there is a great deal more to live
for in this life than mere bodily satisfaction and accumulation of wealth—of
money. Nor is complete luxury one of the most preferable of circumstances.
It is not conducive, under present conditions, to the best
and most rapid development of the true wealth of the soul, nor can it
ever be until correct views of the uses of wealth more generally obtain
than they do at present.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a true condition of society there would be no such thing as
wealth, in its present signification. It would be reduced to the requirements
of men in obtaining better wealth for themselves, and for the diffusion
of it among their kind. In this consideration of the uses of life,
there is no more important feature of it than that of organization in all
departments. Such organization as will dispose of misery, poverty,
ignorance and crime. All these can be cast out of society; and it is to
be sincerely hoped for, that there will be formed a political party having
its basis in the necessity and the possibility of such a disposal. Such
conditions cannot exist in the midst of a community without exerting
their deleterious influences over the higher and better conditions. People
lose sight of this fact, and in all legislation it is ignored. Government
now has the power to take these conditions in hand, and none are
more interested in having it do so than the so-called labor party. Why
should not this party organize upon some such radical principles of reform
that will reach the roots of the ills they feel society labors under?</p>

<p class='c008'>The policy of a party that would be permanently successful must
be one that will include all of the great principles of reform. If such a
party is not shortly organized, there will be conditions developed which
will make such a party a necessity, even without organization. It would
arise as if by magic out of the conditions of the times, and leaders will
rise and come to the front as though Heaven-directed, and they will be
received by the people by acclamation. The force of elections will be
dispensed with, and party trickery forever killed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole substrata of society is in foment. The terrific strifes
that have been waged, and are being waged, lift the weight from the
strata, and it begins to rise into demanding such recognition as has not
been accorded it. The “Moses” who shall divide the “waters of the
Red Sea,” that separates them from their “Canaan,” will be their God-appointed
leader, whom to oppose would be futile. Political parties
have been in the hands of such leaders, and have been used for such
corrupt purposes, that the people have lost all confidence in them, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>they demand <span class='sc'>A New Order of Things</span>, in which common honesty
may properly find a place.</p>

<p class='c008'>Labor and capital, lying, as they do, at the foundation of present
society, and as they will enter largely into all societies of the future, so
long as material wants are conducive to the true interests of humanity,
should receive such consideration at the hands of the present as will
so arrange their interests that there may be no violent disruption between
them, when present governmental forms shall change. The
sphere of government must be enlarged and made to include very many
questions which are now utterly ignored, before society can ever be considered
as resting upon a surely permanent foundation. To arrive at
this foundation is the first and most important step for humanity to
take. All minor ones are insignificant beside it, because the corner
stones of this foundation must consist of a perfect individual justice,
which will not be inconsistent nor at war with perfect collective justice.
This condition the present inequalities between labor and capital forbid,
and hence the importance of their harmonization.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. XII.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps there is a no more suggestive or instructive fact in all the
realm of society than that the laboring classes are the liberal classes.
It is among them that nearly all social reforms begin, and among them
that all governmental reforms first find moving power. The wealthy
classes are systematically conservative; and by instinct they are opposed
to all movements which tend to equalization. They are to social
reform just what bigots are to religious liberalization. They adopt a
creed which their practice is never to depart from, and it is only by the
force of the large majority of the people combined against them that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>they ever do depart from them. The time was when it was the
grossest infidelity to question any of the extravagant assertions contained
in the Bible; but nearly all Christian sects now assume the right
to place their own construction upon what is found therein. This construction
is found to grow more human and liberal every year. Twenty
years ago, the more “hell-fire and brimstone” a minister gave forth,
the more Gospel it was considered that he taught. The same rule obtains
in regard to all social questions, and the same rule of extending
liberalization will continue, until the balancing point of equalization is
reached, in which there shall be no power to determine for the individual,
except himself or herself, what is for his or her individual good,
or what to him or her is right.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wealth, in its present position, is aristocratic; and Labor, in its
present position, is democratic. Aristocracy always assumes to control
that which is under it, in a material sense. It has always assumed this
control, and whenever possible has exercised it. This assumption has
been exercised so long that those over whom it has been swayed have
come to regard it as something approaching a “divine right.” This
condition of servitude was possible so long as ignorance possessed the
masses over whom it sought control. When education began its silent
yet potent work, the power of assumed “divine right” began to weaken.
General education is all that the world requires to emancipate it
from the rule of all kinds of aristocracy. Common schools for children,
and the public press for adults, have done and are doing the work of
emancipation.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not until quite recently that the representatives of labor
began to know the benefits to be derived from organization. They do
not yet know the full benefits which it is possible for them to obtain
from it; much that they do obtain from it is, on the whole, deleterious
rather than beneficial. They require more general knowledge. They
need the aid of science to point out the paths in which they should
seek to walk. Science, to the organizations of labor, is what discipline
is to the army. Without it, the first is powerless, and the last dangerous
to those who command and support it.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is very much to be regretted that so much of bitter denunciation
of the wealthy is heard among laborers. It shows that they, if
possessed of the power, would wield it more despotically than it is now
wielded by those possessing it. Force, as a regulator, can at best be
but a mere temporary makeshift, which, unless quickly followed by
justice in organization, degenerates into absolutism. This is the danger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>which it is to be feared would follow the elevation of labor into
the position now occupied by wealth. Hence it is that it takes long
years of disappointment to chasten the hearts of those who seek change,
before the order of civilization will allow it to come in its fullest extent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Could changes in society be arranged and managed as changes in
other departments are, no danger would ever supervene. New railroad
bridges are constructed before the old ones are removed, and
throughout the process of change the trains continue their regular
movements. So it will be with society, when science shall have so
enlightened the people that they shall know just what they are preparing
to pass to.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Labor Party now desires to be elevated into political place
and power; but have its advocates any well-defined ideas regarding the
results which are to follow such a change in the administration of government?
It is much to be feared that the same old story of “Make
hay while the sun shines,” would be the ruling element. We would
not have it understood from these suggestions that we are opposed to
such a change as the success of the Labor Party would imply. Any
change cannot be for the worse. Principle could not, in any event, be
less the ruling power than now; nor could money buy more politicians
than it does now. One has to spend but a “season” in Washington to
convince himself that there is a deal more truth than there is vulgarity
in the saying, that “money makes the mare go.” Representatives and
Senators who prate with loudest mouths of patriotism and devotion,
spend all their own money and all they can borrow to get to Congress,
and retire to private life, having made a fortune upon “five thousand
a year.” The inference is too palpably plain. It is not necessary for
us to say that all such fortunes are the results of bribery and corruption,
and their possessors public thieves, and utterly unworthy of the
confidence of honest devotees to a popular form of government.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is this species of corruption that is becoming a stench in the
nostrils of all those whose patriotism is more than pocket deep. In its
growth they see the process of national disintegration begun, which they
well know cannot continue indefinitely without bringing destruction to
our country. The almost criminal indifference with which the masses
of the people regard these examples of the power of money over the
consciences of those to whom they have intrusted their most sacred political
rights, speaks badly for the safety of republican institutions, as
now operated. A saving power is needed. Where shall it be sought?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>All true reformers are looking to the Labor party for it. Let it unite
to itself the principle of equal rights, regardless of sex, and it will succeed.
Then, if it fill its mission well, it will prove itself to be what
the present demands, to crush corruption which is so rapidly permeating
our whole body politic.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. XIII.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The principles which should regulate these two great interests are,
even in this age of scientific attainment and philosophic speculation,
very imperfectly considered and still more imperfectly understood.
There can be no perfect practice of the true principles which should
govern their relations until the practices of the peoples are based on
the recognition of the fact of the common brotherhood of humanity.
There are a few people now living who fully appreciate the relationship
which exists between the peoples of the world, and who would regulate
their conduct toward their brothers by the “Golden Rule.” All
the governments of the world are in direct opposition to this rule;
hence it becomes an utter impossibility for isolated individuals to practice
upon it to any great extent.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is an acknowledged fact that the world is gradually being
evolved by the means of government; and that government was at
first organized to control individuals who would otherwise have operated
from their own standpoint for selfish purposes. This kind of control
will continue to be exercised until government will be able to control
all individuals to act for the general public good, and this again will
eventuate in all people acting for the public good of their own accord,
when government in its present sense and for its present purposes will
be done away with.</p>

<p class='c008'>The relations of labor and capital are most intimately connected
with the frame-work of all governments, because they could not exist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>without their active support. The difficulty with all present systems
of government is that they are built upon the supposition that capital
is the primarily controlling power; while the fact is that behind capital
labor stands first and strongest. As intelligence becomes more and
more generally diffused the domination of capital over labor becomes
weaker and weaker, and the dignity of labor more and more apparent,
and, as a necessary result of the growth of this sentiment, labor is accorded
more and wider privileges.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a singular fact, and one to be regarded with a feeling bordering
on astonishment, that it is possible for all legislation to be either
conducted in the interests of capital or controlled by it, when the
capitalists of the country are to the laborers as one is to ten. The
same principle makes it possible for one man to control a dozen horses
possessed of a hundred times his own strength. It is the power of
knowledge over ignorance. The horses on the one hand are ignorant
of their real power and yield it obediently to the command of assumed
authority. So, too, is it with the mass of laborers; they do not know
their real power and they yield obedience to the power of assumption
aided by a superior intellect.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is for this reason that the general diffusion of knowledge among
the common people should receive so much more attention than it has
or does. Every child, whether born of wealth or poverty, should inherit
the right from government of a complete education in all the important
branches of education. Not only should they inherit this
right but the government should see to it that the right is obtained,
compulsorily if need be. The acquisition of knowledge has ever tended
to the liberalization of existing orders of things, and it was not until
something akin to its general diffusion was obtained that any adequate
ideas of the advantages of freedom became fixed in the minds of the
people. It was a grand—almost a fatally grand—mistake which the
people made when they considered that they had obtained complete
freedom when they emancipated themselves from the so-called “tyranny”
of England.</p>

<p class='c008'>First, then, and that which is the basis of all other tyranny, is the
fact that man, individually considered, is, in the strictest sense of the
term, a slave to the conditions of his existence. Whatever else he may
be free to perform he can never be emancipated from the necessity of
yielding obedience to the demands of this existence. In his ignorant,
undeveloped condition, intellectually, he has been led to yield himself
in obedience to others whom it seemed to him were able by their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>superiority, mentally, to better administer to these prime necessities
than he could do it for himself. This was the argument for the continuation
of slavery in the South. They said the negroes were better
off than they would be if cast upon their own resources for the supply
of the necessities of life. Many persons felt the strength of this argument
and yielded to its pleading. It is the same principle—that of inferior
intelligence yielding to superior intelligence—which makes the
possibility of all forms of slavery. It is this principle which has made
it thus long possible for government to be conducted entirely in the interests
of capital.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it is just at this point, where the beginning of comprehension
on the part of the representatives of labor is, that the fallaciousness of
this arbitrary form of control begins to be felt by the masses who
have hitherto yielded to it. They begin to see that they obtained
freedom from one “tyranny” only to yield themselves to another,
less odious than it was from the fact that one was represented by one
person, while the other is represented by numerous persons. In some
regards the last condition is worse than the first; for in it there is
nothing to guard the constant encroachments of the tyrant upon their
“reserved” rights. They are constantly subjected to legislation which
filches from them the last possible farthing, that it may go to swell the
coffers of some wealthy individual or some obese corporation.</p>

<p class='c008'>At present the indications are anything but favorable for the interests
of the producing classes. It seems as though the representatives
of corporate interests, in which large amounts of money are
invested, are organizing to make a crusade against the present possessed
rights of the producing classes, to the end that, by all corporate organizations
combining and making their interests mutual, they may come
into the position that shall give them supreme and lasting control over
the destinies of the country. They behold with jealousy the attempts
at organization among laborers, knowing that, if it is carried to its full
results, it will compel equality of interest and obtain the means necessary
to enforce it.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is the age of rapid change. What it would once have required
an age to accomplish, is now performed in a single night. It would
not <i>be very strange</i> should the interests of labor control the next Presidential
election. One thing is patent to all, some great issue must come
up which will be of sufficient magnitude and general importance to
arouse the people from the slough of indifference into which they have
fallen since the settlement of the slavery issue. It is also equally patent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>that this issue must be some new combat between some form of slavery
and a growing freedom; perhaps a consolidation of the several questions
of progress into one interest to crush out, at once and forever,
the reign of conservatism of all kinds, and the substitution therefor of
an enlightened freedom, to be governed, guided and supported by the
lights of science which shall point the way to all things which ought
to be obtained.</p>

<p class='c008'>What the world needs to-day is, that science, supported by wealth,
shall come into power. Could this be arrived at, the dangers and difficulties
now hovering around the issues between the still captive and
the interests of enslaved labor, would be dispelled, and society, without
further convulsive efforts, could assume its uninterrupted march
toward perfect conditions of existence. It is to be feared that wealth
will not yield to science, and that it will endeavor to bring it under its
sway to further enslave the “toiling millions” and make them minister
longer to its despotism. Let this be as it may, the existence of government
upon its present basis of liberty and equality depends upon its
checking a power that is being organized to control it. The New York
<cite>Herald</cite>, not many days ago, pointed out this danger, but did not warn
the people that it was a danger, leaving each to gather his or her own
deduction from the mere presentation of the facts. Subsequently, however,
it said, editorially, as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now it is possible the American people may not be alarmed
at the probable effects a combination of the capital and influence of
these vast railroad corporations may have upon the future of the
country—upon the permanency of its institutions and the perpetuity
of its political liberties; but, in view of possible contingencies, we
think we are justified in cautioning the people against the possible creation
of a railroad oligarchy here that may prove as dangerous to the
nation in times to come as was the Southern cotton oligarchy in times
past.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This subject is one of considerable interest to the American people,
and the elections of members to the next Congress should be
graduated accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is the duty, then, of the New Labor Party to become the best
representative of general reform and a wider freedom for all individuals,
male and female, which freedom should have no limit except that
which borders upon interference with the freedom and rights of others,
or that would be detrimental to the common interests of the public if
practiced. In the widest freedom there is the most virtue, because,
under restraint, compulsion often passes for virtue, while its semblance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>only is there. Freedom stamps all that is genuine, and exposes and
denounces all that is counterfeit and affected. Enforced virtue in any
direction, except for the protection of the community, is not one of the
principles of a free government; but everything that the government
can do that will further the interests of the community, come legitimately
within its sphere. And it is to this end and purpose that the
Labor party should press its claims to recognition upon the representatives
of labor.</p>

<p class='c008'>The workingman makes the government, and therefore has it in
his hands to unmake it. If the government is not what it should be,
it is because the workingmen have permitted it to exist and not perform
its duty. It seems, then, that the <i>main point at issue</i> is, to acquaint
the representatives of labor everywhere with their power; to make
them recognize the fact that they, being the majority, have it in their
power to elect the men who will legislate in their interests, and, by so
doing, do away with this insane denunciation of wealth by the mouths
of those would-be leaders, who, to become leaders, would stir up any
kind of strife, required to gain their wishes. Of all such, the Labor
Party should beware.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. XIV</h3>

<p class='c011'>We have repeatedly appealed to the productive classes to arouse
from the slough of trustfulness and indifference in which they have
remained so long, and to bestir themselves about their business of governing
themselves. Thus far they have utterly failed in all duties of
self-government. They have nominally lived in a country which proffers
equality to all, but under which proffering they have virtually surrendered
themselves to be governed by the considered mighty few,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>who, for their own purposes, exalt themselves into the position of The
People’s candidates until office is obtained, when they begin at once
to invent schemes for continuing themselves in power; or, if they know
it is impossible to be again returned, they devote themselves to making
the most of what time they have.</p>

<p class='c008'>The present doings of the people’s representatives, both State and
national, are practically limited to getting the most they can for themselves
and their friends, while the study of the interests of their constituents
and the country is either entirely ignored or shirked to the
greatest possible extent. Each year this condition becomes more and
more the controlling element of Congress and Legislature, and unless
soon remedied, it will lead the country on blindly to its destruction.
This course being directly in the interest of special and favored interests,
has the favor and support of capital, while labor looks on with
the utmost indifference, and sees its productions filched year after year.</p>

<p class='c008'>Capital, of the two, is the more foolishly blind to its future; for it
does not seem to comprehend that with the continuation of this course
must come the day of reckoning, in which the debit side of all accounts
will be heavily against it—so heavily that it will never be able to satisfy
the demand which humanity will have for it to settle.</p>

<p class='c008'>This consummation may be averted, but only in one way. The
laboring classes must exercise their right of self-government themselves,
after the dictates of reason and common sense, and no longer
blindly intrust their interests and the common interests of the country
to the self-selected few who prate with so much volubility, and who
mouth the “King’s English” so furiously about their undying patriotism
and self-denying devotion. It may be set down at once and for all
time that the patriotism and devotion professed by this class of orators
and statesmen will be certain to continue until after their election is sure,
after which it will do to watch them carefully lest they may have entirely
expended it in their efforts for election.</p>

<p class='c008'>While we have urged the laboring classes to arouse, we have at
the same time shown the necessity of complete and thorough organization,
and we now further urge the absolute withdrawal of affiliation
with any party, and the devotion of their entire strength to the construction
of their own party, upon the principles of freedom, equality
and justice for all, let them lead where they may. All that is required
by them is granted in the present Constitution, though, perhaps, in some
points, were so, blindly, for the time, but which are now made plain and
clear by late events in some of our States.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>It is time that active movements should begin to be made toward
organization for the next Presidential election. Both political parties
are manœuvring in every possible direction to gain advantages. If the
Labor Party will act wisely it can take up one of these parties and incorporate
its remnants before the election comes off. But if the class
who should form this party will remain stupidly blind, and continue to
maintain these virtually defunct parties by their strength, instead of
constructing a new party of their own, nothing which will positively
shape the future course of events can be accomplished. The old will
simply be bolstered up for another term, and four years more of submission
to the behests and dictates of capital must be endured.</p>

<p class='c008'>There will be a desperate attempt made during the coming session
of Congress by capital to obtain further, and greater and stronger hold
upon the vitals of the country. Efforts to effect the perpetuation of the
franchises it already has, it counts upon making, with certainty of success;
but the very extent of its efforts which it will make under the knowledge
that what is to be obtained must be so at once, will press it to such
extremes that it will most probably defeat its own purpose. This event
will be rendered certain if the Labor Party will take a positive stand
upon its own ground, which will make effective the springing of some
“mines” that are prepared, which will put their representatives in such
a light before the country as will most effectually dispose of all selfish
schemes which are now afloat. Let it be seen that no shirking of duty
is permitted on the part of pretended labor representatives, and also let
it be seen that all who lend themselves to the schemes of capital are
properly shown up to the country.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our interests are great and our country is dear to us, for it has cost
us immense treasure and blood. Is it not worthy of being defended
from all schemes, when so much has been required to construct and
preserve it? To the care of laboring classes its preservation is now
committed. Will they prove themselves worthy of the high trust? Or
will they sell their birthright for less than a “mess of pottage?” Is it
necessary that some great calamity come before an awakening to the
reality of the condition will occur? Let it rather be, that wisdom be
gleaned from the sore trials and the desperate situation of our brethren
in France, which shall teach the use to be made of possessed rights and
privileges.</p>

    <div>PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. XV.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The New York <cite>Sunday Despatch</cite>, of the 20th inst., contains a
lengthy, interesting and highly instructive article, based upon recent
interviews with Thomas Hughes and J. P. Mundella, members of the
British House of Commons, who are also workingmen and employers.
They are strongly of the opinion that “strikes” were never productive
of anything but damage to both parties, and that arbitration is the only
reasonable resort for the settlement of all mooted questions between
laborers and their employers.</p>

<p class='c008'>As examples of the misery engendered by “strikes,” several instances
are quoted, among which is found that of the potters and moulders
in the vicinity of London, which proceeded to the very last extremity
on the part of the strikers. Arbitration at last was resorted to, and resulted
in no gain of conditions to the strikers.</p>

<p class='c008'>These facts go to show that the immediate purposes of labor organizations
are detrimental to their true interests. They must acknowledge
that they cannot compel capital to their terms, and that in moderate
counsels and wise action they will be much more likely to find their interests
advancing.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ultimate purposes of the Labor party which are to obtain control
of legislation, may be productive of much good, or may be made
the most fruitful cause of national disaster. We have all the time endeavored
to show that the real interests of both capital and labor lie
in the direction of complete unity; and that although labor is now
suffering at the instance of capital, that it should not be laid to the
charge of capital that it is in position to thus infringe upon the rights
of labor, but to the charge, secondarily, of legislation, which is performed
by the very men whom the laboring classes do their utmost to elect to
office: and, primarily, to the imperfections in our present financial and
social systems, which must be remedied before any very great benefit
can accrue to the oppressed conditions of society.</p>

<p class='c008'>To accomplish what is required in order that labor may rise to an
equality with capital, the laboring classes must become enlightened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>upon the principles of political and social economy. Revolution, which
is threatened from some quarters, would only lead away from justice
and in the direction of anarchy. We are sorry to be obliged to say
that we can find but little in the present propositions of the Labor Party
which promises very much of good. For the most part, its leaders are
bigoted and cliquish to the extreme, possessing but little of the philosophic
comprehension of the conditions through which labor must be
elevated. Declaration of principles in series of resolutions which form
a necessary part of all political gatherings amounts to nothing unless
the party presenting them “squares” itself by them. This is the fatal
error of all parties and all governments. They set out by making certain
fundamental declarations, which they afterward endeavor to compel
into meeting the exigencies of the times.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a great work the Labor Party can do. There are imperfections
in our government, and these it should take up and remedy.
It is a well-established fact, as every one knows, that a government that is
not a representative of the minorities as well as of the majorities is not a
government of freedom, equality and justice. If imperfections exist
even in the much revered Constitution, it should not be held so sacred
that none of its faults can be remedied. If there are inconsistencies in
it, or if it contain provisions which the present has outgrown, let it be
thoroughly amended, and as often as it can be, and made better. We
do not believe in anything being held so sacred as not to be submitted
to a complete analysis, so that it may be determined just what there is
good, and what there is which can be bettered. We are inclined to the
opinion that the whole Constitution should be revised, clarified and simplified,
and made so plain that there would be no possibility of different
constructions being put upon any part of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our government should soon be so formulated, and the people so
well informed upon the true principles of government, that all existing
administrations should exist by the unanimous consent of all the people.
The strife should not be for party, representing different principles, but
for the best representative men to administer the Constitutional principles
which all would be agreed upon.</p>

<p class='c008'>There will a party arise having these objects in view, and it need
not be predicted that such a party, once organized, will begin a new
era in the history of governments, for sufficient comprehension of what
the future will be exists to make this a foregone conclusion. The Labor
Party should make itself that party. Has it the requisites?</p>

    <div>PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. XVI.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In the full and legitimate consideration of this subject the range
should extend beyond the things immediately attaching to the capitalist
and the laborer as persons, and merge into the question of Philosophic
Equality, out of which consideration arises the true relations of the extremes
of it represented by these two classes. Under a true republican
form of government the inherent right to equality on the part of all its
citizens should not only be recognized but guaranteed. Equality, except
as a mythical name, does not exist in practice in this country; nor
for that matter in any country, except where each individual is his own
governor, to the extent of his power to maintain such authority; and
each individual being possessed of this right to maintain it, comprises
that equality. Philosophic Equality presupposes the right of each
individual to exercise all the powers possessed by him, in which exercise
the rights of no other individual would be interfered with, but
which exercise should not be aided or protected by any device of law.
The moment a law is made to assist an individual, or any number of
individuals, in the performance of his or their undertaking, that moment
equality on the part of all other citizens ceases. Not only is this true
specifically, but it is a great deal more; it is true generally that if an
individual or a class of individuals receive aid, comfort and protection
from the law, in their pursuits, all other individuals of all pursuits are
rendered unequal in their competition with them in all of their respective
pursuits.</p>

<p class='c008'>That is to say, if a person is protected in the manufacture of salt
by the law, which imposes a heavy tax on all foreign salt imported
into the country, the manufacturer or producer of grain is at once
placed by the law in a condition of inequality with him, and in a double
sense if he be a consumer of salt; for not only is the price of the home
manufactured salt increased by the imposition of the tax, while the
price of the home grown grain is not proportionately increased, but the
producer of the grain is obliged to pay the increased price for the salt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>which he consumes. The same rule is applicable to all things wherein
individuals are obliged to seek protection from foreign importations, to
be able to produce the same at home.</p>

<p class='c008'>The argument in favor of this course is, that while protection, extended
to certain interests, increases the prices of their productions to
the consumers of them, the consumers by it are also enabled to
obtain higher prices for what they have to place upon the market. This
is all very well so far as it has any application, but what is the effect
upon the very large proportion of the working people of the country
who are not producers of anything in their own right, but are simply
laborers for such producers? If there is only an equality maintained
to the employers of such labor, how can the benefit extend to the employed?</p>

<p class='c008'>In making this complex argument, it is forgotten that real wealth
and real prosperity do not consist in high prices for everything, but in
the quantity which is actually possessed. Prices under protection must
ever fluctuate, and a person rich this year may be rendered poor next
year, by the depreciation of his property. Witness the fall of real estate
in this city for an exemplification of what we mean. High prices
are not the ultimatum to be gained by any people of any country; but,
on the contrary, the true point to attain is the employment of the industry
of a country in those directions, wherein <i>the most can be produced at
the least cost</i>, in the accumulation of the proceeds of which the country,
as a whole, must become wealthy more rapidly than in the pursuit of
the other extreme, which is the production of the least at the greatest
cost; or in any modification of this proposition.</p>

<p class='c008'>The result of continuous protection to any interest of the country
may be exemplified by the application of it to something which comes
directly home to us. Suppose that there are some gardeners on the
upper part of Manhattan Island who appeal to the city authorities for
protection against the gardeners of Long Island, New Jersey, &amp;c., because
their soil being not so fruitful as that of Long Island and New
Jersey, they cannot afford to sell their vegetables as low as those can
be sold which are produced outside. Thereupon a tax of twenty-five
per cent. is levied by the city upon all foreign vegetables sold in the
market. The result is, that all purchasers of vegetables in the city are
forced to pay the additional cost merely to enable a few insignificant
persons to pursue a calling which they would otherwise abandon for
some other which they could pursue without protection. This, though
a common illustration, exemplifies the operation of special protection in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>all its phases. It enables the few to pursue callings at the expense of
the many without returning to that many any adequate benefit.</p>

<p class='c008'>The trouble with our manufacturers is, that they want to get rich
too fast. They are not willing to begin a new business in a way proportionate
to their small means, and from this grow gradually into large
producers as the manufacturers of other countries have done. They want
to be able to employ labor and pay much larger prices than are paid to
those laborers who toil in unprotected industries. Nor is the laborer
any better off in the general result. The laboring classes of the country
are not so well off under the present system of high prices as they were
before the war, which indicates that the advance in wages has been
more than counterbalanced by the increase in the prices of the laborers’
necessities. As a general proposition, it is true that low prices are
more favorable to the laborer than high prices; and that, under a system
of protection to special favored interests, those interests become
rich at the expense of the laborer; or, in more general terms, the rich
become richer and the poor poorer with each succeeding year.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such is the general argument against protective duties; but it does
not by any means follow that all protection should be immediately
abandoned and Free Trade become at once and fully inaugurated. This
would be as grossly unjust to all these interests which have been encouraged
into existence by the present system, as that of protection was
to the common industries. What should be done is this: Unrestricted
commerce, which would allow of the natural demands of a
country being supplied, without restrictions of any kind, should be laid
down as the true principle, and a gradual approach from present protective
measures to freedom be inaugurated. No immediate jump—nor even
rapid advance that would produce misfortune to any branch of industry,
should it be attempted—but an approach, running through a sufficient
number of years to allow of the adjustment of industries, should
be the course. Under such a system all the various industries of the
country would gradually equalize, and the laborers and employers in
each would approach an equal footing. The farmers of the rich Western
prairies would no longer be able to complain of the discrimination
of government in favor of the cotton, woolen and iron manufacturers of
the sterile East. Whether this policy is immediately adopted by government
or not, it certainly will be, when the rapidly increasing West shall
become the dominant power in it. Better that steps looking to it should
be at once adopted than that it come after awhile upon an unprepared
country, which course has been so often erroneously pursued to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>destruction, demoralization and discouragement of those classes of industries
which require consideration in their youth from the strong arm
of the government; to accord which is not only for the interests of the
country, but which is also its duty to its acknowledged citizens; the
error heretofore having been that the consideration thus extended has
been at the expense of a <i>part of the citizens</i> of the country and not at the
expense of the country as a whole.</p>

<p class='c008'>Equality to all the citizens of the country can only be possible
where there is no special discrimination on the part of government toward
any, whether that discrimination is in the form of specific protective
duties, unequal levies of taxes, or through devices of law; or, in
other words, equality is an impossibility so long as special legislation
is allowed either in our State or National councils.</p>

<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. XVII.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The great object of a republican form of government is to arrive
at that condition wherein all the people constituting its citizens will
stand upon a perfect equality in all things, which can be effected by
government. A government cannot determine that each citizen shall
have equal capacity to apply and make use of the rights, privileges and
immunities which it guarantees to its people, but it can determine that
each citizen shall have an equality of right to these benefits, the perfect
attainment of which must rest with the citizen.</p>

<p class='c008'>The question of Labor and Capital, as was said before, is included
in the greater and more important question of a Common Equality, or
an equality which is predicated upon the fact that all mankind are
brethren. A republican form of government should find its fountain
in this fact, and all its causes should be governed by its deductions.
All the means of providing for the administration of the government,
for its maintenance and for the correction of any existing abuses, should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>be formulated with this one greatest of all human possibilities ever in
view. Thus formulated, its practices would ever tend to bring all the
people into a comprehension of it, which comprehension is now scarcely
existent except in meaningless words, which are dealt from pharisaical
pulpits. In our last number the practice of protection to favored interests
was considered, with reference to its general effect upon other
unfavored industries; the unequal working of the system of levying duties
does not stop with generalities; it extends and touches a still more vital
point, and one which the people are more sensitive upon than almost
any other. The laying of specific duties upon imported goods and
wares is an indirect way of <i>taxing</i> that portion of the people who consume
such imported goods and wares. It not only makes it possible
for the protected interest to exist at the expense of other interests which
consume, but by this operation the government obtains revenue which
is an indirect tax gathered from those who are compelled to pay the
advanced prices which the levying of duties implies. The amount obtained
by such unequal and indirect methods of revenue for the last
fiscal year was the enormous sum of $194,448,427, every dollar of which
was in reality but an additional tax drawn from the individuals who
purchased such imported merchandise. This manner of levying taxes
would not matter so much as a system of taxation did it fall equally
upon the taxable property of the country, upon which general taxes
are levied, but nearly $100,000,000 of the above sum was collected upon
woolens, cottons, sugar, molasses, coffee and tea, of all of which the poorest
in common with the richest are almost equal consumers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Laborers of the United States! How like you this manner of filching
your hard-earned dollars, under the specious, fraudulent name of
“protection to home industries.” It is no wonder that your hard-earned
wages will scarcely supply your families’ necessities, when you
are compelled to pay such a sum upon the most common staple articles
of general consumption. It is no wonder you are continuously laborers,
never being able to become producers upon your own account, when
you, who should not, and, under general principles of taxation would
not be called upon to pay a single dollar as a direct tax, are thus burdened.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus it will be seen that the levying of specific duties on imported
goods is a most unequal and iniquitous manner of taxing the poor laboring
classes of the country to support the government, which is administered
to all intents and purposes in the interests of the rich, and
under which the really poor become poorer every year.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Nor are the other means to which the government resorts to support
itself entitled to very much more consideration than that of the
indirect one just mentioned. There is no equality to the general people
in any of them; and it is quite evident that the whole system of revenue
for the support of the government should be remodeled, so as to
fall where it should, in justice, upon the taxable property of the whole
Union. This done, and a sound financial system also inaugurated, the
lower classes of society would begin to be leveled up to the medium,
and the upper classes to be leveled down to the same basis of material
prosperity.</p>

<p class='c008'>A system of taxation for the support of all government—town, city,
county, state and national—should be formulated and inaugurated, based
upon the proposition that all taxes should be general and none special.
All of these taxes, for the several purposes, should be assessed, levied
and collected by one set of revenue officers, and thereby an immense
system of economy introduced, whereby the collection of the
revenues of the country should not consume, by one-twentieth
part, what is now consumed in the almost innumerable methods
which are adopted to obtain the people’s money by indirect means. All
of these subjects are for the laboring classes to take up, examine, decide
upon and rectify, and never will they obtain the possibility of an
equality until this is done. Never can equality be possible under the
forms through which government is now administered and supported,
and never will the laboring classes become independent of the wealthy
classes until the freedom, equality and justice, which are the birthright of
every citizen of the United States, become possible of attainment under
its government.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>PAPERS ON FINANCE AND COMMERCE.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. I.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In the following papers it will be our design to treat the questions
of Finance and Commerce in a somewhat different manner from the ordinary
and current way. The mere records of the transactions had in
the world of money and of merchandise belong to the ordinary method
of dealing with all matters that interest the people. The facts—the results—only
enter into the consideration, and if serious conflict or serious
faults are recorded, no attention is paid to the sources from which they
spring, and from which they will continue to spring so long as the
sources furnish the causes. All subjects, and all parts of the common
interests of humanity, will receive from us not only the attention which
the present demands, but if the present brings unhappiness to humanity,
or does not bring happiness, the fountains will be examined to discover
where the stream takes on its bitterness and its sediment—and, for instance,
produces financial disease—with the view of exposing to the people
what causes their unhappiness or lack of happiness.</p>

<p class='c008'>As society is constituted at present, nothing within its interests has
so much power for good or ill as money. He that has it is independent—is
a free man; while he that has it not is dependent—a slave in some
one or other of the forms of slavery. Men recognize that this is an
imperfect condition of society, made up, as it is of people born free
and equal in the eyes of the law, and by it entitled to their chosen path
of happiness. These being the birthright of every one, the construction
of society should be such as to guarantee it to every one. As
society improves its condition, the advance made will be ever toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>practical equality in all temporal things. It is the duty of those who
labor in the interests of society to lay hold of the future, and bring its
conditions into the broadest present application.</p>

<p class='c008'>Money being the corner-stone upon which society is now built, is
thereby that stone of all others which should be perfect, not only in
form, but perfect in duration: that is, it should be of such composite
elements that time nor change should be able to produce any effect,
either upon its external appearance or upon the arrangement of its parts.
It becomes apparent, then, at first observation from this standpoint, that
our present corner-stone is not one that can endure; it becomes plain
that it not only will change, but that it should change, because of its capability
to meet the requirement of a perfect corner-stone, upon which
society can rest with perfect and continuous security.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gold has long been the accepted money standard of value. Intrinsically,
it has no value other than for the other uses to which it is
adapted, but custom and long usage have raised it into the position of a
god, before whom the world falls down and worships with as much devotion
as Pagans do before their various gods. And, considered as a
god, none other has in this day and age one-half the power, nor is any
other worshiped with one-half the devotion it is. This may be considered
an unjust reflection upon the so-called Christians; but let them,
as a class, examine themselves individually, and if the analysis does not
sustain the proposition, we shall be very willing to confess our error, and
appeal for forgiveness. Gold <i>has</i> been the accepted money standard,
but the practice, since the depreciation of our country’s credit, has, to
all intents and purposes, reduced it to a mere commodity. Our money
is not measured by Gold—Gold is measured by it. It may be said that
this is merely for temporary convenience, but nevertheless it is so measured,
and the practice has demonstrated that so far as facilitating exchange
of products in our own country is concerned, its use might be
dispensed with. If it can be dispensed with and trade continue, its importance
as money entirely disappears. Would dispensing with its use
offer any impediments to commerce with other countries? But this article
is simply introductory, intended rather to indicate what our treatment
of finance will be, than for the discussion of any of the questions
that arise under it. These will remain for future consideration; here we
will simply state that we do not believe gold to be a true standard of
value; that we do not believe its use as money is at all necessary; that
we do not believe that its use as money contributes to general prosperity;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>and that we do believe that its use will be supplanted by a new
medium—the true representative of that portion of the real wealth of
the country which is at the given time in the process of exchange.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. II.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Finance and commerce are so intimately connected that one cannot
be treated without the other being, at least, indirectly alluded to.
If these terms are analyzed, their relations will be perfectly understood.
Commerce is the simple exchange of something one individual
possesses for something another individual is possessed of. This exchange
may be between neighbors, or between nations; it is all commerce.
In ancient times, articles of merchandise were exchanged for
articles of merchandise, but as commerce increased in amount, and its
limits became extended, it became necessary to make use of something
that should represent value, so that there need not, in all cases,
be an actual transfer of property for property. The medium used to
facilitate these exchanges was money in its first phases, and out of this
necessity have grown all the different monetary devices made use of, at
various times, in the history of civilization.</p>

<p class='c008'>To demonstrate that money is only a convenience and not an absolute
necessity, any one has only to observe that frequent purchases,
sales and payments are made without the use of money or any other
representative of value, but by the direct transfer of value for value.
It is plain, then, that money, be it gold, silver or what else it may, if
not intrinsically of the value set upon it, but that it represents something
that has intrinsic value. If this is questioned, let any one who
doubts it procure some gold in its original state and endeavor to make
exchanges with it. He will find that no one will receive it, even at
its value by weight. Were he to apply to a dozen places where gold,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>in mass, is dealt in, he would be offered a dozen different prices for
his article. It is only after gold has passed through the hands of the
government, and has received its impress as an indorsement, that it becomes
current as money.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is further to be observed that the time came when even coin became
too burdensome to be directly transferred in making exchanges,
and something representing it was brought into use. This consisted
of bits of paper, containing upon them promises to pay so much in
coin, &amp;c., &amp;c.; and under this practice banks of issue sprung into existence,
their issues being supposed to represent a gold or coin basis of
value. But a full representation alone of coin deposited was found not
to supply a sufficient circulating medium to accommodate the movement
of produce, and for other uses, and it became customary for the
banks to expand their issues beyond the amount of coin on hand, upon
the supposition that these promises to pay would never be presented in
sufficient quantities to consume their actual specie. But suppositions
are only true <i>generally</i>, and hence it came that promises to pay often exhausted
the ability to pay, and here began the ills that must necessarily
attend a false standard of values.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all seasons of financial distress, gold, as a standard, has failed.
The necessities of our late war demonstrated and represented the fallacy
of an absolute standard in gold, and happily suggested a better standard.
No sooner did the supply of gold at the command of the government
fail, than the latter was compelled to resort to its credit, or to a
direct representation of the true value and wealth of the country. The
credit of the government was the ability and intention of the country
to meet the promises of its government, and this ability determined
its currency. It was not the amount of gold, absolutely, that the country
was supposed capable of acquiring that thus entered into consideration,
but the ability of the country to produce certain quantities of merchandise,
which should, in time, be sufficient, above consumption, to
balance these promises to pay. It was the productive capacity of this
country that gave value to its currency and bonds irrespective of gold.
The productive capacity of a country is then the virtual standard of
the value of its currency, and as gold can only be obtained by the
products of the country, its necessity as a medium may be dispensed
with. It is now predicted that the sooner gold, as the money god, is
dethroned in the hearts and customs of the people, the sooner a sound
and perfect system of finance will be inaugurated.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>That there is a true standard of value, and one that can never fail
in time of need, nor be made use of for speculative purposes as gold is,
must be apparent to every thinking mind. How many of the people of
this country, during the last eight years, have received gold or silver for
what they have disposed of, or have used it to purchase their necessities?
And yet the talk of a return to specie payment is everywhere
heard. When will the idol worship of the god of gold be completely
abolished?</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. III.</h3>

<p class='c011'>We have said that there is a true standard of value, and that this
is based in the capacity of a country to pay without infringing upon
the country itself; that is, without resorting to an actual transfer of
supposed title to any part of its domain for something the domain itself
produced. Actual ownership in the soil of a country is an assumption,
as has been stated in the “Papers on Labor and Capital.” If the
title to any real estate is traced back far enough, it would be found to
have originated in the practice of “Squatter Sovereignty.” The inhabitants
of a country having the right to make use of the land they occupy,
render it more or less valuable, according to the amount they
can make it produce, whether it be in the shape of its natural products
or those of artificial assistance, or whether it is simply occupied for purposes
other than production.</p>

<p class='c008'>The basis, however, of the value is in the productions of the soil
of a country; it matters not how much value may be added by the art
of man to what nature furnishes. This would find no scope for action
did the earth not first yield the fruits of her bosom to the hand of the
artist. The finest cloth, the most delicate silks and laces, the most
costly jewels, even the light that robs night of its darkness, are all primarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>the products of the earth. Without this yielding of the earth
there would be nothing. This giving up of the earth to the demands,
efforts and desires of man, is the process by which he acquires all his
wealth. Even the gold that has so long been called money the earth has
yielded, and still yields. When this is considered in its true light, we
come to a realization that gold is no more money, absolutely, than any
other of the different products of the earth, but with them all it forms
the real value standard. Gold is relatively valuable for the general
uses it can be made to subserve; so, too, and only so, are all other products.
Any other metal might just as well have been selected out of
which to coin money as gold. It no longer answers the purpose it has
been used for so long. It is not “radical” enough to suit “the times.”
It is one of the landmarks of conservatism, reminding us that once it
required at least six months to communicate with, and receive an answer
from, London, whereas we now know the 5 o’clock P. M. closing
prices of stocks in London at 1 o’clock of the same day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such annihilation of time and space is entirely ahead of, and above,
the era of gold, which must yield its sway to something more elastic, and
consequently possible of better adaptation to the constantly varying requirements
of the peoples. The world having been so long held in
financial bondage to gold, is now approaching a period wherein it will
rid itself of the yoke. A very few people in the world rule it. What
of the thrones of Europe without the Rothschilds? and what of them if
not for gold? The vast debts of those countries alone render crowns
longer endurable. Just a little more intelligence among the common
people—just a few more newspapers and readers, and the work is done;
those who play king, and they who are the real kings, will fall together.
Kings rule the people, but money rules kings. This is beginning to
be realized, and the realization is not satisfactory to those who produce
wealth; they do not care to live under the tyranny of a god they themselves
have fashioned. But after gold, what?</p>

<p class='c011'>If gold, as a medium of exchange, is behind the requirements of
the times—and that it is has been pretty fully demonstrated—some reform
should be instituted to supply the failure; some reform—not merely
to meet the exigencies of present time and circumstances—which
should be inaugurated as a permanent change.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our government, during the last war, was obliged to resort to what
was considered then by nearly all people, and is still considered by
many people, as very extreme measures, in order to furnish the material
by which the war might be carried on. Without the greenbacks we
never could have succeeded as we did. To the person who conceived
this project we are as greatly indebted as to our generals, who successfully
prosecuted the war upon the means furnished through his financial
foresight. This was one means of resorting to the credit of the country.
If the credit of the country was sufficiently good to furnish it with the
means to carry on such an exhaustive war as ours was, it surely should
be good for any peaceful time.</p>

<p class='c008'>For our part, we cannot see the propriety of returning to specie
payment; and there is one insuperable objection to it. Gold cannot
furnish the circulating medium for the world, and credit must be resorted
to; and the necessity of having two kinds of circulation involves
difficulties which the mercantile world would be glad to have forever
done with.</p>

<p class='c008'>Why should people be obliged to use one kind of circulating medium
to purchase another kind with, and then use this second kind to
pay his debts to another party, who will sell it again to obtain what the
first person used to purchase it? This is the logic of specie payments.
If it is argued that the actual transfer of the gold is not necessary, we
would then ask why is specie payment desirable at all? The facts regarding
this question are that people have become wedded to the idea
that gold is the only possible thing that can be made money, while all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>their practice has been that it is the least entitled to the name of money
of anything they have ever used as such.</p>

<p class='c008'>As has been said, the real standard value of a country is its capacity
to produce, and it is this production that requires to be moved, exchanged,
bartered or sold. The use of something to represent this, for
which it can stand responsible in general terms, is what is required of
money. That kind of money which will best meet all these requirements
is the best money. That kind of money which has elasticity,
that will be plenty when business is active, and that can be readily put
to other use for profit when business is less demanding, is the kind the
prosperity of a country demands. With a money of this kind, all financial
crises would be impossible. It is the possibility of making a stringent
market that unsettles financial matters and causes financial
destruction. And it is because we have not a financial system of
our own that it is possible for exigencies in other countries to
unsettle values here. To-day, the price of our securities in London
determines the price of gold here. In view of the possible
complications in which Europe is liable to be involved any
time, and which she must within a very few years be involved in, it
becomes a matter of considerable moment, whether our finances are to
be governed and guided by the condition of things there, when these
things shall come.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a nation we are or can be, were it necessary, independent of
the world, and are the first and best representative of a republican form
of government. Why should we not be the nation to give to the world
a reformed currency? The world—or that part of it which has grown
to appreciate our kind of freedom—involuntarily turns its eyes to us
for patterns of all things that a people during a change of government
require. One of the first things a government requires is money. Why
shall we not show the nations how to make the best use of their means,
and give them a system that will do more for them than any system
that has yet been tried, and by so doing also meet our own needs?</p>

<p class='c008'>The capability to do this would instantly place us at the head of
nations, and financially to stand thus, is to complete the measure of our
greatness. Politically, we can never be subdued. During our late war
there were two millions of men under arms. Just in this proportion,
also, should we be powerful financially, and to become so would be to
be allotted by the world the lead of it and all its nations.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. V.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The gravest of all questions of political economy is that of a country’s
money. A very great deal more of the people’s common happiness
depends upon money than even political economists generally suppose.
Happiness is very closely allied to prosperity, and general prosperity
in a country can never obtain unless it is under a sound financial
system. Very few people understand what general prosperity
means. It does not mean vast sums of gold in the hands of a few of
the inhabitants of the country, while the great majority struggle month
after month for the absolute necessities of life. There may be a great
deal of money in a country and still be very little general prosperity
with the common people. The question of money has never been considered
philosophically, nor with due regard to the common interests of
humanity. It is always viewed from the standpoint of the wealthy,
and usually by the wealthy or by those in their direct interests.</p>

<p class='c008'>The producing classes, however, are beginning to awake to the
fact that they have never been represented in any of the legislation
that has been had regarding finance and the currency they have been
forced to use. On the contrary, they perceive that all legislation has
been in the interests of capital, and this perception is what is arraying
these supposed two interests against each other. The facts existing
have only to be considered to prove that our financial system is unsound,
and this should be sufficient to force our legislation to take up
the question, and to handle it in the light of the demands of the present,
utterly regardless of the superstition that has so long existed about the
gold idol.</p>

<p class='c008'>The objectors to any thing as money but gold, make much of the
need of it to make good the balances of trade between different countries.
But these forget that gold is nothing but merchandise until the
country has placed its indorsement upon it, and that it is this which gives
it the character of money, and that it does not derive this character
from the fact that it is gold. The indorsement of a country upon gold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>coin is a simple guarantee that it is of a specific purity, after this, its
value is determined by its weight. Thus gold sent to other countries
to pay balances against us, is sent and received, as so much by weight
of a specific quality of gold, and not as so much of our national money.
The force of this objection, then, is utterly destroyed by these considerations;
and especially so, when this same gold, coined by our government,
is recoined by the country we send it to. Here it is distinctly
proved that gold is not money, and that it is only a commodity which
we produce and part with in exchange for other commodities, and that
it is just as valuable for this purpose if it goes direct from the mines
where we produce it, to other countries, as it is if it goes by the way
of a United States Mint, where it receives the indorsement of the government.</p>

<p class='c008'>To go still deeper, there is a no more mischievous idea than that
all paper money should be redeemable in gold which should alone be
legal-tender, because everybody knows that the amount of currency this
country demands cannot by any possibility ever be redeemed by gold.
It may be redeemed by using the same gold coin over and over again,
as it is again and again received and paid; but just here is the difficulty;
for ten dollars of currency in reality have to be redeemed by
the one gold dollar. This is the <i>practice</i> of specie payments, and a most
mischievous one it is, too; it is the sole idea that leads to great inflations,
and consequently to great collapses in finances and values. Under
this system there never was nor never can be a reliable mercantile value
to anything. Fluctuation is its direct result, while speculation, without
this, would cease, and the vast horde of mere speculators who spend
their whole time in it, would of necessity be compelled to become producers
of some kind. It will thus be seen that the first principles of
economy are in direct opposition to the results coming from the use of
gold as money; and that these declare that something should supersede
its use as such that it would be impossible to speculate upon; something
that would have such absolute and never varying value as could
be positively counted upon to endure a month, a year, a century or a
thousand years, as the cases in question should respectively involve.
Such a substantial thing might with propriety be called money, and in
comparison to it gold would sink into utter insignificance and be forgotten.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. VI.</h3>

<p class='c011'>A very fallacious argument has been the rule, because gold has
been considered “money,” that all currency is “credit;” this at first
blush would seem to be still further strengthened by the proposition
that gold is only merchandise. By no means, however, is all currency
credit. All bank currency is credit. All currency that is not legal-tender
for contracts and debts is credit; but a currency which is of
itself legal-tender is money, because it is itself intrinsically valuable.
All the uses one has for money it fills; it not only meets all demands
that “credit currency” can meet, but it fills other and specific demands
that bank currency cannot. It is receivable for nearly all governmental
demands upon the people; it pays taxes, and cannot be refused by any
one in payment of contracts and obligations. Such a currency has all
the features and characteristics of money, except that in our practice it
has not been receivable for duties upon imports. Had greenbacks been
made legal-tender for all governmental purposes, they would have been
“real money,” having intrinsic value, of which nothing short of the
absolute destruction of the country and death of its inhabitants could
have robbed them. The gold fallacy, however, prevented Congress
from seeing the real drift of what they did, and the country, therefore,
must yet a little longer be blinded by the thought that gold is the only
money.</p>

<p class='c008'>The only argument which is at all tenable, that converts anything
that has all the qualities of merchandise into a measure of value is, that
the article thus rendered costs at all times, and in all countries, the
same labor to produce it. This test, every one knows, is not applicable
to any single thing the earth yields; and as little as to any other does
it attach to gold, and, therefore, gold in itself is subject to fluctuation,
and can in no sense be considered an absolute measure of anything.
This country, since California began to yield her gold, has been a great
producer of the precious metal; that is, a certain amount of labor has
produced a larger proportionate quantity of it than has generally been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>produced in this or in other countries; consequently we have been
large exporters, not of money, but of gold, in its character as merchandise:
very much of this has been exported in mass, uncoined, in which
condition not even the most rigid gold stickler will pretend it is money.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hence it follows that we do not need “money” to balance our accounts
with other countries; we need particular kinds of merchandise
which we have in larger quantities than we have use for, or which other
countries need more than they do some merchandise they have which
we require more than they do; which system brings about exchange,
the sum total of which is commerce. If commerce were left to regulate
itself without any interference to prevent the natural flow and reflux of
the products of the earth, as stated above, there would soon become
established permanent courses for certain products, to take which would
still further localize all kinds of labor, and render each of nearly unvarying
profit. It is this interference with the natural demand and supply
of the various parts and peoples of the earth that breaks down the
equilibrium of labor, and makes possible the extreme unequal distribution
of wealth.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be seen that all questions of finance and commerce are intimately
connected, while those of labor and capital grow out of the conditions
they make possible and inevitable. To properly understand the
relations of capital and labor, and to harmonize them, demands a correct
comprehension of the basic principles of economy which relate to
finance and commerce. If these were based in correct universal principles,
there could be no questions to settle between labor and capital.
Hence it is that it becomes specially requisite at this time, when labor
is rising to a sense of the unjust position it is confined to, that these
questions of finance should be agitated as the most important ones for
adjustment. To begin at the root of the evil is the philosophic way to
deal with all the ills of society as it is with all ills which result in the
gradual evolution of all departments of the universe.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a measure of value and to aid exchanges, then, there is required
a currency, or medium, that does not possess any of the characteristics
of merchandise, that is not a commodity nor a product in any sense of
those terms, but something that has intrinsic value of itself, being a true
representative of value, and of equal and absolute value at all times
and under all circumstances and changes. Such a thing would be
money, and anything not possessing these requirements is not worthy
the name of money.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>The question arises, then, Can there be anything formulated or
brought into use that would possess all these requirements under all
circumstances? It is quite certain that there never has been, as yet,
anything used as money that was as absolute as a dollar, as a pound is
as a pound, or as a foot is as a foot. A pound is just a pound under
any and all circumstances; so, too, is a foot under the same; and so is a
gallon, and so is a cord of wood; whether a greater or less number of
any of them are required at one time or another for use, they are always
a pound, a foot, a gallon, or a cord, and no more nor no less. Now,
what we require is a measure of values of just as fixed and absolute a
character as any of these. When this is acquired, then just as unvarying
value will attach to the measure of values as there does to those
measures. Money is but another name for values, and the dollar is one
of the divisions of its measures. There is no more reason why money
should fluctuate in its capacity of measuring or of being measured than
there is that the foot should grow longer or shorter, or the pound greater
or less, and there is just the same reason why it should not.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, the products of the earth once placed upon this unvarying
standard, the cost of producing each different product would determine
its exact value, and in time the producers of each kind would be upon
an exact equality in regard to the value of their products. It is the attaching,
in practice, of absolute value to something that can have no
absolute value which makes possible all the various degrees of poverty
that belong to the laboring or producing classes. If these inequalities
are to be remedied, there is but one method by which it can be done—that
is, to reduce our money systems to the same fixedness that we have
reduced all our other systems to. This once done, all labor will gravitate
to an equality, and capital will become its best ally instead of, as
now, its apparent enemy, while each of these interests, and all divisions
of each of them, everywhere in the world, would become mutual, and
by so being would prepare the way and lay the foundation for that
grand harmonization of society which must precede the practical co-operation
of mankind, as brethren, under a universal unitary government
of the United States of the World.</p>

<p class='c011'>The point has now been arrived at where it is to be considered
as decided that gold is not, cannot, be money; that it is a valuable article
of merchandise. Its utility beyond this character has not only
departed as a principle, but in practice a very considerable portion of
the most enlightened people in the world consider it the source of great
mischief, and the more the causes of the financial ills we are subjected
to are analyzed, the more they will be found to be dependent upon the
attaching of a specific value to something that is as changeable in cost
of production as it is possible for anything to be.</p>

<p class='c008'>The philosopher and the best reformer would here step in and say
that it is their province not so much to tear down the old as it is to
prepare the new that shall take the place of the old. This is the science
of all reform. However, before there can be a field prepared in which
the new can be used, the defunct condition of the old must be pointed
out, and its <i>debris</i> cleared away, so that the new may find space for
operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>This preparation has in reality been already made. The necessities
of the Government in the late war broke the first ground for the
consideration of this very important question, and prepared the minds
of the mass of the people, though, perhaps, unconsciously, for the reception
of the idea that it is possible to do without gold; that specie
payment is by no means a necessary accompaniment of a sound financial
condition, and that a money system which is made dependent upon a
redemption by something else, is not only not to be desired, but that it
is the real foundation for all financial disasters, because it makes an
undue expansion possible. The people who would once have considered
a proposition for an irredeemable currency with the utmost alarm
now discuss it as one of the things that is sure to be. It is believed by
those who have studied this subject deepest that the time has arrived
when this government must enter upon the consideration of a permanent
change in our financial system, and that a return to the gold standard
would be a disaster.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>But, says the objector, how can an irredeemable currency ever be
made to adapt itself to the varied demands of the country? How can
anything so unsubstantial as a paper currency, without gold support,
be made as absolute a measure of values as the yard-stick is of distance?
and, if this can be accomplished, where will the elasticity of the
currency be found? In general terms it is assumed that, unless the
proposed financial system will answer all these conditions—that unless
it will be elastic, adapting itself to all the demands that can be made,
be they great or small, and at the same time remain absolute in its
value, it is not even fit to be thought of, much less to be seriously considered
as a substitute for what has been.</p>

<p class='c008'>And this brings us back to the beginning of the argument—to the
point from which the first departure was made. The course that will
be pursued, however, after leaving this point this time will not be that
of reconnoitring—looking over—the ground to be covered, but a steady,
firm and final advance directly toward the objective result desired,
which, if a failure is made in reaching, the campaign against gold may
be considered a failure. Under the system of currency being good only
when it can be redeemed by gold, there is required, to make the currency
actually in circulation good, just as many gold dollars as there are currency
dollars—that is, if there is at any time in circulation any more
currency than there is gold to redeem it, then there is an expansion,
which any sudden change in any of the circumstances by which nations
are surrounded is liable to convert into a collapse. So long as everything
is prosperous, so long as nothing arises to shake the confidence
of the people, or to call the attention of any considerable number to the
possibility that there is not gold enough to redeem all the currency that
is in circulation, so long everything goes well; but so soon as any one
of said conditions occur or change, then there is a rush to see who shall
get what gold there is; the supply exhausted, the unredeemed currency
is valueless. This is the practice and the result of a redeemable currency;
the same results will also follow so long as such a system is
tolerated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Everybody knows that there never has been a currency in circulation
sufficient in quantity to meet all the requirements of commerce
that had a complete basis in gold, and everybody also knows that there
is not gold enough in the world to meet this specific requirement.
Hence it is that institutions possessing, say $100,000 in gold, put forth
and obtain interest upon $500,000 in currency—that is to say, with a
real capital of $100,000, which is worth six per cent. interest, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>really obtain thirty per cent. interest, thus making it possible for them
to double their original capital every three or four years. Did those
who now so loudly complain of the National Banks receiving interest
from the government upon their bonds deposited, and from the people
upon their circulation, ever object to the greater enormities of the specie-paying
banks?</p>

<p class='c008'>The only use of money is to facilitate exchanges of what the earth
produces, voluntarily or under compulsion. Money, then, has its direct
relation to these products as a whole, and can have no special relation
to any part of them; if made to enter upon and sustain any such special
relation, it is a purely arbitrary law, without foundation in principle,
that compels it, and all arbitrary laws belong to the ages past, when
brute force was required to guide ignorance; they cannot be long in
this age without generating irritation, and such irritation is now being
rapidly developed all over the world, wherever the laboring classes
have become at all advanced in knowledge. The few can no longer
control the many; the many are to control the few. Capital, through
false systems of values, has been able to control labor; but the time
has nearly come when the producing many will control the accumulated
wealth of the world for the benefit of the whole world—not simply and
only because they are the many, but because they are to be reinforced
by the invincible powers of demonstrated science, which are always to
be found operating for the “greatest good for the greatest number.”</p>

    <div>PAPERS ON FINANCE AND COMMERCE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. VIII.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Money was invented as a method to facilitate the exchanges of
the products of the industry of the world. If this is a true definition
of money, the only legitimate money it is possible to have is something
that naturally grows out of the uses it is required for. A national
currency, then, should be a representative of that which it is its
sphere to exchange; that is to say: a currency dollar should stand for
a certain amount of the different products, which have been produced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>at the expense of a certain amount of labor. It will be perceived that
this representation is upon an entirely different hypothesis from that of
a currency which is supposed to represent gold.</p>

<p class='c008'>To begin with something which everybody can understand: It may
be supposed that a farmer, occupying a given quantity of land, can, in
a series of ten years, produce an average amount of ten thousand dollars
per year to dispose of commercially. During the process of production
he is obliged to have, say, eight thousand dollars’ worth of
means to enable him to continue the process. Now, instead of his being
obliged to obtain credit based upon his prospective crop, he is supplied
with a representative currency based upon it; this enables him to
purchase from time to time that which he requires. When his crop is
harvested, it is disposed of, and his currency is <i>redeemed</i> by it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, make this application general to all kinds of production in
the country—which is the only basis of value a country can have—and
make the government the appraiser of the value thereof, and the maker
and utterer of its representative, and a currency will be obtained that
will possess all the requirements and characteristics of money; because
it will be used to exchange that upon which it is based and of which it
is representative, and which is substantially redeemed every time it exchanges
any products of the country.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, how shall this system be instituted? In the census now
being taken, the value of the total products of the country can be arrived
at, which sum total should be used as the basis of issue, and continue
as such during the next <i>ten years</i>, at the end of which time the
increased products would require another valuation to amend the bases
for an increased issue for the next ten years.</p>

<p class='c008'>A currency thus obtained would possess all the substantial value
that could be required of money. It is really the basis of value when
gold is used; for how are a people to obtain gold unless they have produce
to exchange for it?—which operation is, in reality, nothing more
than the exchange of one commodity for another, of which it is not and
cannot be representative, while in the case of the proposed currency an
exchange is effected for that of which it is representative.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this view of currency for a country, our system of greenbacks
come nearer being money than anything that has ever been in use in
this or in any other country. They were based upon the capacity of
the country to produce, and had the government confined itself to their
use, and had not been obliged to invent some further means to predicate
securities, we should now have had a real money currency. Who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>is there to find fault with “greenbacks” as a national currency, provided
there are enough of them to transact the business of the country
with, <i>and no more than just enough</i>? But they lack one essential
quality of real money—they are not receivable for all things that people
need money for, and which the government demands of the people.
They should have been made receivable for all government demands,
<i>even for duties on imports</i>. But the necessities of the government, which
was then struggling with all its might for existence, made it a “military
necessity” to exact gold for duties on imports, as an indirect way of
taxing the people who could afford to indulge in the luxuries of foreign
products.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though not available for duties there never has been in the history
of the world so stable and invariable a measure of value as the
greenbacks, since government ceased issuing any more than the
amount already out. There has been no great financial panic and no
considerable unsettling of commercial values. They require that one
thing more should be done—they should be given a <i>fixed measure of
value</i>. Then nothing more could be required of a currency than would
be found in the greenbacks.</p>

<p class='c008'>The reason, and the only reason, why the people can feel that
such a currency may be unstable is the fear that the government may
be induced to issue it in greater amount than primarily authorized, and
consequently that it would depreciate; but this could not be until the
nation should issue more than the value of its property. But for this
deficiency there is a good and sufficient remedy, which can be provided
and used in connection with the proposed new currency, which is to be
based upon the capacity of the country for production, and which will
also provide for different seasons or parts of seasons when more or less
circulating medium is demanded to fulfill the business indications of
the country; and with this it is believed all the objections are covered
that can possibly be raised by the most strenuous stickler for a currency
with a gold basis, though the government may issue never so great a
volume of the currency proposed.</p>

    <div>PAPERS ON FINANCE AND COMMERCE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. IX.</h3>

<p class='c011'>There are several propositions which should always remain in all
considerations about money, so that the mind may not be led from its
true sphere, and so that it may not be invested with peculiarities and
characteristics that never did nor never can belong to money:</p>

<p class='c008'><i>First</i> and most important—most important because it is the determining
point which gives all that follows tangibility—is, that <i>money,
in its primary uses, is a means and not an end</i>. It is a means, because
it was invented to assist the people in performing something that
could be performed without, but not so well without it. And this is
the <i>sole use</i> of money. Because this has been lost sight of and it
has been invested with other functions, it has been possible for it to
be converted to uses which at times, in culminating, have almost turned
the world topsy-turvy.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Second.</i> Money is the medium of exchanging commodities, and
when diverted from its legitimate use and is made an end, results will
ever follow which <i>must</i> be detrimental to the general interests involved.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Third.</i> All the material value money possesses is so possessed
because of the relation it bears to commodities, that relation being representative
of or standing for.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Fourth.</i> While money is the medium of exchanges, and while it
is in use representative of valuable materials, it is in its <i>last</i> analysis the
<i>objective</i> of that department of life of which labor is the <i>subjective</i>, and,
therefore, when scientifically viewed, it resolves itself into a principal
which is one of those upon which society must be built when a perfect
foundation is formulated.</p>

<p class='c008'>In providing a currency, therefore, to meet the uses which are
demanded of it, its <i>scientific</i> feature, as a principle, should be the point
of departure, and should be the only guide until it is attained. Labor
being the basis of production, is the positive power which reaches forth
and expends itself, where money, the other pole of the social battery, is
reached; this reaction upon labor completes the circuit, and here is the
process which is continually going on: A certain amount of labor—a
positive power—produces a certain amount of money or negative result
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>The interference with this natural process by extraneous means,
through which undue quantities of negative forces are accumulated, is
that process which robs labor of its natural and, therefore, just results.</p>

<p class='c008'>The labor which the people of this country are capable of performing,
then, is the real basis upon which money should be formulated,
and, as in practice, the results generally are annual in their return, this
basis should be measured by all they can produce annually. It follows
that the basis upon which money should be uttered is this annual capacity
of labor, and there should be sufficient uttered to completely
measure this capacity, between which two, when once established, there
would be an equilibrium produced, which would only require to be
permanently regulated and maintained to insure a perfect harmony in
the material interests of society.</p>

<p class='c008'>For example, let it be supposed that the extremest legitimate
amount of currency that would be warranted under the previous rule is
one billion of dollars; and that this amount is all that the uses of money
require when there is the largest amount of business being transacted.
It must be remembered that this is not a redeemable currency, but that
it is money; that it is the representative of the wealth of the nation,
and that the government, as the head of the nation, has uttered it,
upon the soundest and best basis of value any money could possibly
have—the productive capacity of the country. In this money system
there could be no such thing as the failure of banks to redeem their
issues; nor of any loss to be sustained by the individual because of
the mismanagement of any board of directors; and what is more than
all the rest, in the present systems of society, its value would be sustained
by the collective accumulated wealth of the whole country, and
it could by no possibility depreciate in value so long as the value of
the country was not exceeded by the amount of the issue.</p>

<p class='c008'>To guard the people against all apprehension of such a result ever
being possible, there should be a measure placed upon this currency
that will at all times make it just as absolute in its measure of value
as the pound is in its measure of weight, or as inches are in their
measure of distances. Though this is comparatively a new proposition,
and one that but very few minds think a possibility, it nevertheless
is just as possible and just as essential—and more so—as all other
absolute and arbitrary standards are, that have been invented to give
regularity and stability in their respective spheres of use.</p>

<p class='c008'>This currency—this money—should be made convertible into a
United States Bond, which should bear such a rate of interest—say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>four per cent.—as experience has or should demonstrate to be the true
point of balance; and the bond should also be convertible into the currency
at the option of the holder. The rate of interest should be open
to readjustment every ten years, when the estimates for the currency
are made. Thus it would come that whenever there should be so
much currency in circulation that it would be worth less than four per
cent. for business uses, the surplus would immediately be converted
into four per cent. bonds; and whenever money for business should be
worth more than four per cent., the bonds would be converted into the
currency in just sufficient quantities to meet the demand and to restore
the equilibrium.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be readily seen how perfectly this meets all the requirements
of money, and how perfectly all the irregularities of demand and
supply are met by it. Thus, when business is dull, and but little
money is required, it (the surplus) will be in bonds drawing four per
cent. interest; the moment business revives, the bonds will be at once
converted, and the currency will meet the demand, and thus the constant
conversion of the one into the other will regulate and maintain
the equilibrium that all previous systems of money have so signally
failed to do.</p>

<p class='c008'>In our next the advantages of such a system will be still further
considered and expounded, so that every one may be able to comprehend
that a money system is possible of invention, upon which foreign
bankers can not play their long-practiced games to any further one-sided
advantage.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. X.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The advantages of a currency which, instead of possessing the capacity
of redeemability, is at all times convertible into something that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>is itself productive, cannot fail to be appreciated by all who have given
any attention to the science of money. Theories regarding this branch
of social science have been about as destructive to the proper development
and understanding of the science as religious theories have been
to that of a proper appreciation of the functions and the benefits of religion.
The last have at all times stood in the path of progress. So, too,
have the first. And for this reason are we to-day almost at the mercy
of those who are possessed of the accumulated wealth of the world,
which in combination would be a power sufficient to control all government
in its interests, and thus it would be enabled to bring the
world again under a despotism to which that of past despotism would
hold no comparison.</p>

<p class='c008'>In such a money system too much circulating medium could never
be uttered, for the moment a surplus quantity over the demands of legitimate
business was in circulation, that moment it would begin to be
converted into the four per cent. bonds; so that if there were two thousand
millions uttered, it would always be worth just four per cent.;
and if there were but five hundred millions uttered, it would never be
worth any more than four per cent. Thus it is plainly to be seen that
the government would always be necessitated to provide just as near
the amount of circulating medium demanded as it would be possible to
arrive at, <i>and no more</i>; for on any such surplus it would, as a matter of
course, be obliged to pay the interest provided, which thus becomes the
absolute measure of value that money requires to make it substantial,
and which is required to deprive it of that capacity for producing great
commercial inflations, which, in the financial history of this country,
develop and burst about every second decade, and which produce not
only the complete destruction of all purely speculative enterprises, but
also the most wide-spread and fearful demoralization in all legitimate
business.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under such a money system, speculation, with all its accompanying
demoralization, would rapidly depart from all classes of society. It is
a notorious, yet unappreciated fact, that speculative enterprises lie at
the foundation of all financial disorder, for which, if a remedy can be
provided, the very considerable talent and time which is now devoted
to it would be turned into channels of general usefulness and productiveness.
Production is the foundation of all wealth, and, consequently,
to increase wealth, production must be increased. Speculation is that
spirit which constantly saps the vitality of wealth, and, therefore, society
has no greater nor more debasing enemy than speculation.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>It may be objected to by some that speculation leads to national development;
that in many of the wild railroad, emigration, city and
other schemes, that have been projected and carried through under its
stimulus, the welfare of the country has been subserved. To this ingenious
objection it may be answered that, under a sound financial system,
these enterprises would have been undertaken everywhere when
the demands of the country warranted them, and because there was a
demand for them, instead of for the pure purposes of individual or corporate
speculation. One of the best results that would flow from this
change of incentive would be, that no “Bubbles” could be palmed off
on the unwary by “flash” advertising, which would burst at some
future time, to the destruction of some deluded victims of unscrupulous
financiers.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is one of the most fatal of commercial errors to suppose that
large general prices are an evidence of prosperity. On the contrary, it
is true that when the prices affixed to any kind of property are larger
than its real capacity for production, it is an expansion which must at
some time collapse, to the detriment of the holder. Thus, whenever
property is valued at such a price that it cannot be used to pay a certain
per cent. income, its value is expanded, and though this expansion
may continue under the pressure of a so-called prosperity, and become
general, even country-wide, if the general productive capacity of the
country cannot sustain this increased value, collapse must as surely
come as results follow causes. Even in this demonstration it is conclusively
shown that the productive capacity of the country is the <i>real</i>
measure of value, and that, <i>finally</i>, no matter how irrelevant the process
of wealth and prices may have been to it, <i>it is the power which ultimately
measures all values</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>This appears to us such a plain proposition that it seems almost
superfluous to present further arguments to prove the desirability of at
once proceeding to make the productive capacity of the country the
basis of value upon which to issue a currency to meet the legitimate
demands of the people for the purposes of exchange. The attention
of all who realize the unstableness of our present system, and the desirableness
of providing against the tremendous fluctuations it is capable
of, is called to the necessity of uniting to bring this matter prominently
before the <span class='sc'>next Congress</span>, with the view of having it thus
brought prominently before the <i>country</i>, and of having it thoroughly
analyzed and understood. When analyzed and comprehended, the idea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>of a <i>gold basis</i> will forever depart from all progressive minds, and the
impetus the new money system will thereby receive will never be
checked until its science is developed into general national practice.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. XI.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In our last, the necessity of urging the consideration of the finance
question upon Congress, with the view of having the whole range of the
matter brought prominently before the country, was proposed. Of all
practical questions that require immediate solution, none is of so much
importance to man as this; and none more so to woman unless that of
equality for herself is. No country can enjoy a series of years of uninterrupted
commercial prosperity when that country has a circulating
medium which can be affected by the manipulations of shrewd financiers
for their own ends. And no financial policy is more ruinous to the
true interests of a whole country than that of a constantly changing commercial
valuation upon either personal or real estate, excepting alone in
the latter, when it becomes the location of more capacity for actual production.</p>

<p class='c008'>Real estate, abstractly considered, has no appreciable value. It
only becomes relatively valuable when labor can make use of it to produce
something valuable from it or by it. Absolutely there can be no
individual title to any part of the soil of any country. Taken as a
whole, the land comprised within the limits of the authority of any
government can be made such use of as such government may determine,
but as to actual conveyance of absolute individual ownership,
that is impossible, because none of the powers involved in the attempt
at conveyance could have had any part in the production of said land,
and, therefore, could have no right or authority to transfer it, from the
fact of an entire lack of title to transfer.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>It may be objected that these are merely technical assumptions
which the customs of society have never admitted. So, too, may it be
objected to all encroachments of scientific principles upon old forms
and customs. Nevertheless, science continues to analyze and demonstrate,
and the world continues to come more and more under its guidance
every year. In the principles of government science has not,
until very recently, found grounds of attack. Since it has come to be
recognized that there really is a science of society, and consequently
that all its structure can be analyzed, understood and guided by its deductions
many of the customs and practices that have so long controlled
the people are found to be entirely without the support of principles
fundamentally necessary to assure a permanently constructive form of
society.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wherever maxims of temporary policy are the guiding rules, there
will ever be alternate construction and destruction; but wherever scientific,
demonstrable principles are the governing power, there will be
found permanency. That “money” is susceptible of analysis, and of
being predicated upon a scientific basis is no longer to be questioned.
It is a branch of the science of society, and as such must receive consideration
as the science itself becomes disseminated among the peoples.
It was not many years ago that “the sciences” were unknown in our
common schools. It will not be many years hence until the science of
society will be a recognized branch of every child’s education in the
most enlightened portions of the world. Political economy, which is a
branch of social science, is regarded with favor by many now, and, comprehensively
speaking, all these questions which have been looked upon
as “too abstract” for common comprehension, are found to be the real
principles which underlie all social strictures.</p>

<p class='c008'>First in importance, because it leads to the recognition of the “ultimate
condition,” is the question of intercourse between the peoples of
the earth. Money, as the means of bringing about this intercourse,
should receive primary consideration. Let the fact once be generally
recognized that the world is at last tending to “a unity of the peoples,”
and financial and commercial unity are the introductory unities upon
which to hasten governmental unity. Were these fully established
upon a basis of mutual interest instead of upon the policy of each obtaining
all the personal and selfish advantages possible, there could no
such strifes as the one convulsing Europe to-day ever occur. Thus it
appears that the assimilation of the world under one common interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>is in the first instance a question of a unity of material interests which
must serve as the foundation for all others to build upon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finance and commerce, then, lie at the very threshold of all the
progress that is to be made in the direction of governmental consolidation,
and when so recognized they will be rescued from the position that
they now occupy as the means only of pursuing selfish interests, and be
raised into that of principles and rules of action by which all intercourse
must be regulated. Commerce, in its most comprehensive sense, does
not apply merely to the exchange of the material products of the world,
but to the exchange of intellectual, moral, social and religious products
also, and its application thereby becomes common to all the interests
of humanity. And as finance grows out of the necessities of commerce,
it also becomes equally with commerce a humanitarian question. It is
in this broad and general sense that all questions regarding it should
hereafter be considered and not upon the basis of how much advantage
such a measure will give an individual or a nation over another individual
or nation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Like all other questions that are now coming prominently before
the world for solution, this one of finance and commerce rises to the
dignity of a question of humanity. They are all to be considered in
regard to their application, not merely to nations, but to all nations—all
peoples—as forming the basis of the future confederation of the
world under one government to be known as the United States of the
World, when all the people will be inspired with a common Religious
sentiment in regard to their primary origin and their ultimate destiny;
when all the peoples will be governed in their relation to each other by
the common social sentiment arising from the recognition of the fact
that they are necessarily a community of brothers from having a common
origin and destiny; when all the peoples will give a common adhesion
to and support the deductions of a Universal Science, let those deductions
militate as they will and must against whatever of speculation and
theory there may still hang like a pall of night over the intellect of
man. To all of these ultimate conditions of mankind, finance and
commerce must furnish the means of attainment; and being thus the
first essentials to the beginning of the actual constructive process which,
when completed, will be this grand consummation, they should be
treated with that gravity and consideration which is due to so grand a
position as they are assigned in the third order of general civilization.
Policy should be entirely discarded from all place in the argument, and
principles should alone be discussed. When the consideration is fairly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>begun upon this basis, scientific ideas regarding money will be rapidly
diffused among the people, who now do not even dream that money
can be reduced to the rules of scientific demonstration.</p>

<p class='c008'>We urge again that this question should receive its proper share
of attention at the hands of our next Congress as being the questions
upon which the future good of mankind depends more immediately
than any other that will be likely to command the undivided attention
of it. This once settled upon the true principles, all other questions
which all future Congresses will have to consider will be virtually determined
by it.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. XII.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In the treatment of these subjects in the general sense in which
they become important to all the people the range is very much extended
beyond that commonly compassed by those whose interest
compels them to temporary considerations for the promoting of immediate
interests under the systems in vogue. All such kind of treatment
deals with effects, and would never remedy an existing want, nor correct
illegitimate practices. If there are wants in existing systems, and
if there are illegitimate practices which are possible under them, there
is but one way to supply the one or to correct the other, and that is to
go to the root of the matter where the causes exist which make these
possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this series of articles it has been the endeavor to point out some
of the most prominent evidences that our financial system was unsound,
and also to show, by as strict an analysis as was possible in the space
allotted, what the true basis for a sound financial system was, and where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>it was to be found, and, having done this, such methods of administration
were hinted at as would reduce the system, when put into operation,
to a permanent and fixed measure of all values, which it was
argued was equally as necessary when value is to be measured as the
same fixedness is when any other quantity is to be measured.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been suggested by some that, in presenting our statements
in the terse, undiluted manner we have, that those who have not been
habitual thinkers upon this subject might fail to catch the full application
of the propositions, and by so failing consider the system impracticable.
To obviate such objections we shall, by further treatment of
obscure points, attempt to make them plain to all who can understand
the English language.</p>

<p class='c008'>First, a brief re-statement and condensation of the entire outline:
Money, being an invention to facilitate the exchanges of the products
of labor, it should be formulated with direct reference to the conditions
which made the invention necessary, out of which it should naturally
grow; and also with direct regard as to how the invention should best
meet the required case—that is, the invention should be adapted to the
conditions, instead of making an invention without regard to the conditions,
and then attempting to force the conditions to comply with the
capacity of the invention.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is a point which should be thoroughly comprehended, for in
it lies the whole fault of making gold a measure of value, and we
therefore shall attempt to offer a common illustration directly in point.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let it be supposed that there is a stream which, to accommodate
travel, requires to be bridged, and that the bridge has to be constructed
and moved to the stream. The first procedure would be to determine
just how long the bridge must be to span the stream. It would then
be constructed and moved to the stream, which it of course would span.
But suppose persons knowing there was a stream to be crossed, but not
knowing its breadth, had gone to work and constructed the bridge and
then had attempted to compel it, when too short, to extend across the
stream. This would have been a case of attempting to compel the conditions
for which the invention was made to accommodate themselves
to the invention. And this has been just what the world has been all
this time doing in attempting to compel the conditions for which money
was invented to accommodate themselves to the possibilities of gold,
which was invented as money without any reference being had to the
functions it was to perform, or to the conditions it was required to meet.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>It would be just as reasonable and just as sensible to attempt to
compel a house to perform the functions of a bridge as it is to attempt
to compel gold to perform the functions of money, for gold is not nor
cannot ever be made to meet the requirements for which money is demanded;
whereas, money should be of such character as to fully meet
the requirements for which it is used, but should not be possessed of
<i>any qualities that would render it useful for any other purpose whatever</i>,
so that there could be no possibility of its ever being used for any
other purposes, which impossibility would forever make speculation
impossible.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is believed that we have made clear the purposes for which money
is required and also clear that it is utterly futile to attempt to compel
any invention to meet those requirements where it is not formulated for
the express purpose. We have heretofore shown that gold is a purely
arbitrary standard which has no scientific relations whatever to the product
of labor which it is required to measure, but that it is itself a
product, and as such requires to be measured. A gallon of molasses
would never be thought of as a measure of distance, but it would be
just as reasonable to expect it to measure it as it is to expect a certain
quantity of gold to measure the value of a horse. A horse may be exchanged
for a certain amount of gold. So, too, may a horse be
exchanged for a certain amount of wheat, but that process does not
make either the horse or the wheat money. Money is that which can
equally represent the wheat, the horse and the gold; and anything that
cannot do this is not money.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hence it is seen that every step we take in examining the true bearings
of the money question brings us nearer and clearer to the proposition
already made—that the capacity for production is the true basis
of value.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. XIII.</h3>

<p class='c011'>We are perfectly aware of the very many objections which arise
in the minds of the people to such a currency as has been proposed, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>the thoughtless one of “What! an irredeemable paper money! Oh,
no! that will never do; that means utter repudiation,” which is the
most commonly made, scarcely merits attention. Will those, who so
earnestly place themselves in opposition to a convertible currency,
stop and consider for just one moment. What is the ten-dollar gold
piece you have just received for a ten-dollar note good for? Will it
feed or clothe you? or will it <i>directly</i> minister to any of your needs or
to those of any of your family? Directly, it will do none of these
things for you; <i>but you can have it really redeemed by something that will</i>
feed, clothe and minister to all your requirements. You will thus
perceive that you have been and still are laboring under a foolish delusion
regarding this precious metal, for you have all the time been
getting your paper money redeemed by your gold money, which you
finally are obliged to redeem by that which is really valuable—that
which it takes to maintain life and make it desirable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, you know very well that the gold there is in the world cannot
redeem or represent the values of the world. Were it a thousand
times as valuable as it really is—that is to say, could the consent of the
world be obtained to making the amount of gold which now represents
one dollar to represent a thousand dollars—there would be a possibility
of the gold in existence representing the value of the world; but as no such
result as this is anticipated, it is in vain for you to cling to any such
mythological and speculative theory.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again: What terrible outrage would your conscience sustain if you
would give a little calmer consideration to a proposition which you
have always heretofore rejected without thought. With your gold you
have been able to obtain that which you required to sustain and make
life agreeable. These necessities, then, are the really valuable things
of the world. What objection, then, can you make that can have the
sanction, even of your own reason, to at once admitting that these are
the only real values the world contains, and consequently—because
legitimately—that whatever is money must be a representative of these
valuables: and also and further, that anything bearing the name of
money, which does not justly and fully represent the sum total of these,
is not money in the true sense of that term.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again: Money may be considered the negative pole of the battery
of value. To all things there are two extremes and a mean, the evidence
of perfection being that there is always an equilibrium sustained
between the extremes through the medium of the mean. Products are
positive existences which go forth to administer to the demands of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>human nature, and expend themselves in the negative returning force,
money; which, in being brought back to the point which it represents,
becomes a positive power itself, having the capacity to obtain labor
which restores what has been expended, and thus the circuit is complete
and nothing is lost; the same products exist and the same representation
of them also exists. If, perchance the return of the products
is not always immediately made, the power to return them is never lost,
though that may be in a thousand years.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus it will be seen by all, if they will but give the necessary attention,
that the proposed currency which shall be representative of the
products of labor is not only the only natural money there can be, but
that it can never appreciate nor depreciate, because every twelve months
it is worth just one twenty-fifth part of itself—for it is believed that this
per cent. of increase is the true balance between accumulation and production;
if, on trial, this balance should be found too small, or too much
in favor of production, it would be increased; and if found too large, or
too much in favor of accumulation it could be reduced. This must be
a subject of test, and when tested, legislation can increase or decrease
the standard of value by making the “measure” larger or smaller,
just the same as it does other “measures.”</p>

<p class='c008'>We believe that the inauguration of such a money system would
be the beginning of the “leveling down and the leveling up” of the
capitalist and the laborer, and that such a thing as practical equality
will be impossible under any less radical and comprehensive change
from present systems. It is to be hoped that that large proportion of
the whole people which is represented by the classes that desire to be
“levelled up,” will give this most serious matter their most serious attention.
We are aware that it is a subject but little understood, and
that the prejudice of the people is in favor of the money god, gold. But,
as in religion, so will it be in money; when reason and common sense
are admitted to the debate, mythologic spectres and theoretic fancies
will begin to assume their true shapes, and the realities to arise from the
depths in which they have been confined.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>BASIS OF PHYSICAL LIFE.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c010'>THE UNITY OF LIFE, POWER AND MOTION.</h3>

<p class='c011'>I beg to present the following as the foundation for a series of
articles which it is proposed to present in due time. At first glance it
may be deemed too abstract for the purpose in view, but it must be
remembered that all action is primarily derived from a common basis
of life, and that it is from this basis all action <i>must</i> spring, because
general principles only are deducible from it:</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.” Although human conception cannot trace
existence back to the time when “the Word was God,” the proposition
is one which consciousness can accept without analysis, and define
and understand as the Absolute in its broadest sense; but, when invested
with the infinitude of phenomena and facts, the mind loses itself
and gives way beneath the universal evidence that life, power and motion
form a unit. Accepting, then, this proposition, without attempting
to solve it, a basis is found from which to reason, and which we could
not have discovered by reasoning backward from effects. God was in
the beginning: the beginning was God. Acknowledging this, the
mind cannot conceive of aught else existing in the beginning. He
was the Supreme Whole, the great Central Heart, from and by which
all things were to come. This truth should be fully accepted, for from
it can be shown that the facts of the present are the legitimate outgrowth
of this complete Oneness.</p>

<p class='c008'>All nations have had a god or gods, though no two of them have
been identical. Nor has the conception of a god remained unchanged
with any people for any great length of time. Were each person to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>define his idea of a god, there would be nearly as many different ideals
as there are individuals in the nation, thus showing that all knowledge
is relative or symbolic. As there can be but one god conceived of under
our proposition, the question arises how so many can be held up
before the Christian world, and each claimed to be “the only true god.”
In the solution of this will be found the chief burden which ignorance
and superstition use to load the mind with their absurdities. Freed from
this burden, the mind would form a true conception of the unity in
diversity of nature, and recognize God as infinite and eternal. It will
be readily admitted that God is indestructible. So, too, is matter.
Then we have from the beginning two indestructibles—or, at least, for
the present, it must be assumed they are two—God and Nature, Spirit
and Matter, or Power and Resistance. These embrace “the Whole,”
from which nothing could have been taken away or added thereto. As
God, therefore, was All in All at the beginning, so he must ever remain
the same; and this is true also of Nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>Reasoning thus from this basis it must be found that every power
has its origin in the first power—God, the mainspring of all action.
Life, then, may be said to be motion making itself manifest under the
influence of power—to what? It may be difficult for the mind to accept
so broad an application of this all-pervading power, but it confesses
it without comprehending it whenever it declares that God is
omnipotent and omnipresent. The world little thinks of the extent of
such an assertion, for it breaks down all the Christian ideas of that antagonism
known as the Powers of the Devil; it banishes the possibility
of creation proving a partial failure and enables the soul to recognize
an ever-present, all-pervading, though inscrutable God.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may then be asked, Is God omnipotent? If believers in an
incarnation of Evil answer yes, what becomes of the foundation for
such a belief? If no, what becomes of their God? If He be omnipotent,
He must be not only the source of all power, but All Power. To
assert otherwise is to declare that there are two infinites—an assertion
which contains its own refutation. While the mind can conceive that
God is All in All, it cannot at the same time conceive that He is not
All in All, or that the Devil is a part of the All in All, in opposition
and contradistinction to God. Those, therefore, who believe that God
is All in All, and also believe in a Devil, believe an impossibility, for
two persons or things cannot be the same, or occupy the same place at
the same time. The absurdity, then, of the divisibility of the Supreme
Power becomes at once apparent. The argument is of importance as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>it furnishes a well-defined basis, which meets every difficulty and
arrays it in support of the unity of all things and the supremacy of
God.</p>

<p class='c008'>The question, what and where is God? has been often asked; but
the various attempts to answer the unanswerable, have only given the
unreflecting mind another’s idea instead of a just and comprehensive
conception of God’s complete existence. In reasoning on so important
an inquiry, the mind should soar above principles and ideas, and in
one vast grasp say that God is the whole. Where is God? He is
everywhere. In this answer we have no clearer solution of the query
than we have when we say God is incomprehensible to the human
mind; still the form is such as the mind can use in measuring its relative
parts.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the Great First Cause, and from it alone, has come the present
in all its beauty and variety, material and spiritual. Though the
effects may continue to increase in number throughout an infinite future,
the sum of them can never amount to the First Cause. God must and
will forever remain superior to all the effects of the workings of this
power.</p>

<p class='c008'>The material universe, science tells us, is composed of some
sixty-four or more elementary parts. An element cannot be resolved
into two or more different substances. These elements combine under
certain conditions and in certain proportions with each other to form
compounds differing materially from their component parts. Everything
we see in nature is formed of these elementary materials; yet,
extensive as these compounds are, they are fashioned according to
universal and unchangeable laws. While the existence of any of the
elements uncombined is rare, their combinations fill all space, and are
co-extensive with the Divine Spirit. Spirit and Matter—God and Nature,
seem, therefore, to be forever united.</p>

<p class='c008'>But how have all these things come? What is this inexhaustible
power everywhere manifested, and what the laws governing its application?
Go back to the time when no compound bodies existed on
this planet, and what was there? God was there in all his absoluteness,
all his infinity. All the elements of matter were there in the
same proportions and quantities as now exist, but uncombined. In
an abstract sense, an element is a unit mass, without life, power or
motion. What constitutes it an existence, gives it life, power and
motion, and the capacity of combining with other diverse existences?
We cannot conceive of matter, even in its simplest form, as devoid of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>all active life principles, for that would be to conceive a place, occupied
by matter, where God is not. Each element, therefore, contains its portion
of the Eternal Spirit, without which it would not even be a substance,
but with which it can unite with other similarly endowed
simples. It seems impossible not to conclude, then, that the life, power
and motion found in all material substances, is that life and power we
call Infinite.</p>

<p class='c008'>To further illustrate this indwelling life principle, we quote from a
celebrated author, who, speaking of the “winds and currents of the sea,”
says: “Men try to explain everything by the wind and the current.
Now there is in the air a force which is not wind, and in the water a
force that is not current. This force, the same in the air as in the water,
is effluvium. The air and the water are two masses of liquid nearly
identical and changing mutually into each other.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
The effluvium is alone fluid; the wind and the current are only impulses.
The effluvium is a steady stream&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and is
invisible. Yet from time to time it says, ‘There I am;’ and its way of
saying so is a thunder clap. The sea is as much magnetic as watery.
An ocean of forces floats unknown in the ocean of currents. To see
in the ocean only a mass of water is not to see it at all.” To which we
would add, that to see in the manifestations of nature, nature only, is
not to see it at all, for the power producing it is not recognized. What
is seen is not the reality, but that through which the reality makes itself
known.</p>

<p class='c008'>What has thus far been considered may be consolidated into this
comprehensive proposition: That there is a power existing everywhere,
of which we can know nothing absolutely except that consciousness
tells us it is. At the same time we are conscious of our incapability
to define or comprehend it, and that all we can ever know of this
power is its physical manifestations. Hence the knowledge of what we
see, hear, feel, taste and smell is abstractly symbolic and relative, the
only absolute knowledge we can possibly have—if knowledge it be—is
a consciousness of our infinite existence. In this view of the existence
of God, which is the basis of all religious ideas, religion may be
said to be superior to science, because it remains immovable in consciousness.
Religion belongs to the unknowable; science deals with
the knowable, which is the manifestation of the unknowable. Therefore,
viewed philosophically, religion and science stand for the subjective
and objective whose relations comprise the whole. The presence,
then, in consciousness, of what we can by no means account for, must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>be the actual presence of that of which consciousness is made up—the
elementary spiritual principles representative in us as individual existences
of the great Infinite existence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ambiguity in the use of terms leads to confusion of ideas and
thought, and is one great general cause of the ignorance and superstition
still existing among apparently enlightened nations. Many terms,
supposed to convey certain well-defined ideas, are found to be deficient
when analyzed, and others stand for nothing in substance. Many are
in common use whose meaning the man of religion, science or philosophy
would be embarrassed to explain. Chief among these are: The
Infinite, The Absolute, Causation and Effect, Power, Motion, Matter,
Space, Time, Resistance, Eternity, Immortality, Good, Evil, Heat, Light,
Rewards, Punishment, Justice, Law, Order. As the argument proceeds
it will be seen how nearly the whole of these and many similar terms
are resolvable into the few which convey realities.</p>

<p class='c008'>All things that can be resolved into parts cannot be said to be existences.
Existence carries with it the idea of permanent continuity,
something self-dependent, superior to everything else as an entity.
What one term will express absolute superiority? The universe of
space is occupied by matter which, acted upon by an incomprehensible
Power, produces manifestations or motions. These being successive,
time becomes a necessary constituent. Do we need any other term to
cover all the manifestations? Is there any part of the universe left
untouched by the few terms? But allowing that they include the
Whole, some one must be of primary consequence, while the others are
auxiliary thereto.</p>

<p class='c008'>The term Motion will be found, on analysis, to be the result of
Power acting upon Matter, and the proposition is comprehensive enough
to include every known movement. Hence every manifestation in the
material world can readily be accounted for by the combination of
these two terms. Though not so immediately apparent, it will be shown
that mental manifestations are also included in this. If all manifestations
are then explainable by these two terms, all minor terms must be
but names for the different forms under which these two manifest themselves,
and into which they must ultimately be resolved. Motion, it
was found, was resolvable into Power and Matter. Can these be resolved
into anything more general than themselves?</p>

<p class='c008'>The universe is composed objectively of matter. Is it made up
of anything else? An absolute vacuum is an impossibility in thought.
Then what we term space is filled with something, and only matter is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>comprehensive enough to include all. But matter alone would convey
the idea of space filled with something at perfect rest. The term
motion then becomes necessary. This involves a subject, the cause of
the motion; and an object, the thing moved—power the cause, motion
the object. Can these be resolved into anything more general? As
stated, the universe is composed of matter, manifesting itself by and
through motion; and motion, as was seen, can be caused only by the
application of power to matter, and no other term is sufficiently general
to comprehend the causes of motion. By the union or duality of
power and matter everything is brought within the sphere of consciousness,
if not of comprehension. But which of all the manifestations of
power acting upon matter is of primary importance? Of which does
consciousness earliest take cognizance?</p>

<p class='c008'>The universe of matter is boundless. Space conveys the idea of
something beyond which there is nothing. Else it would be limited
by that which is beyond, and we can conceive of nothing as existing
without extension, and extension implies the occupancy of a certain
defined limit, which limit must be within space. Space being undefinable,
that which occupies it must partake of the same characteristic when
considered as a whole. The same line of reasoning applies to power
and time. Succession of events compels an occupation of a part of
infinite duration as matter, relatively considered, occupies space; that
is, between two or more separate facts there must be a lapse of time
before consciousness can arrange them so as as to take cognizance thereof.
Whether this is of itself an actual existence, or some method of
an actual existence, it is a necessity to consciousness. Hence, time is
related to power as space is to matter. Power and matter being the
subjective realities, while space and time are their objective results, or
the necessary effects of the experience in consciousness of their united
result, which is motion. Our ideas of space and time are derived from
experiences of power acting upon matter, while motion, the effect thereof,
unites the two in consciousness as relative realities which must be a
part of absolute realities.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is clear, then, that all we can know of the unknowable arises
from our experience of power and matter, and that within the sphere
of their manifestations all effects are included. But while each is necessary
to produce effect, we must not forget that we would have no
consciousness of the existence of matter were it not the object of the
application of power; hence we must conclude that power is of primordial
importance, and, as such, the most general and comprehensive of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>scientific terms. All knowledge and consciousness grow out of experiences
of power, which must be considered the general ultimate. All
theories regarding it are but theories. Power is untouched by them,
while matter, space, time and motion may be considered either as its
constituents or as modes of its manifestations.</p>

<p class='c008'>To make the argument more complete to those unaccustomed to
resolve phenomenon into its ultimate cause, some illustrations of such
resolutions will prepare the mind to accept the conclusions arrived at:
Let it be supposed that some circumstance calls for the manufacture of
cotton cloth unlike, in some respect, any ever manufactured—say in
width—how must it be produced? Reasoning inductively and given
the raw material, the last necessity apparently is a loom that will admit
of the width required and the prepared webbing and filling. Still, the
cloth cannot be produced without the further aid of motion in the loom,
which motion must be generated by power through certain machinery,
obtained from setting free such portion of power as had been concentrated
in coal. This expands water into steam; steam in escaping compels
the piston of the engine to move, and this motion is communicated
to the loom, the required cloth being the effect. It will be seen that
whatever intermediate processes were necessary they were all resolvable
into the power concentrated in the coal. What was then of first importance
in the production of cloth? It was neither the loom nor the
cotton nor the machinery, but the power giving motion to all. This
illustration may be used symbolically to explain everything incomprehensible
in the universe, that is, all manifestations of power working in
and through matter, producing motion and its effects.</p>

<p class='c008'>All material effects being explained by power acting on matter,
may not this simple formula equally symbolize all mental operations
the product of which is thought? The question primarily arising
would be, what is thought and how is it produced? Let us analyze it.
Something cannot be produced from nothing. Thought is something.
Thought is then the product of something previously existing. Immateriality
cannot be conceived of. Therefore thought is not only material
in itself, but the product of matter in motion; and as motion is
only possible through power applied to matter, thought must be a result
of such an operation. Can it be explained and comprehended upon
this theory? Let it be supposed that some great noise should suddenly
occur just outside a house in which were 5,000 people. Each one
would ask the mental question, or “think,” What was that caused by?
Now, that thought would be the product of the sound heard. But how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>heard? Simply thus: Rapid vibrations of the air, caused by some unknown
matter in motion, came in contact with the organs of hearing,
were transmitted to the nerves, and finally taken up into consciousness.
The whole operation is a purely physical one, and there is a perfect
equivalent between the amount of vibration and the resulting sensation;
in other words, the effect corresponds to the cause. It may also be remarked
that a hundred physical bodies of different weights produce as
many different sensations; the difference being always in exact proportion
to the difference in their respective weights. Similar differences
follow when matter at various degrees of temperature comes in contact
with the body. The same is true regarding light upon the optic
nerve.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us next see if that variety of thought or sensation which arises
spontaneously within the individual is due to any different agency.
Perhaps the most comprehensive and conclusive evidence of the material
origin of thought is, that a child born under even favorable circumstances,
but kept from all external, material and mental manifestations, grows up
a simple idiot. Without, then, the manifestation of power acting upon
matter, no original individual thought or conception is possible with the
supposed exception of spontaneous thought hereafter to be treated.
Further evidence of this is seen when an adult is kept in solitary confinement,
or cast away upon an uninhabited island; memory fails, language
is lost, and the person becomes a semi-idiot. The following extract,
from an address by Dr. J. W. Draper, is made to show that scientific
men are admitting the fact that the mind is the result of the processes
here indicated—a collection of facts gained by impressions constantly
repeated. He says: “There are successive phases&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
in the early action of the mind. As soon as the senses are in working
order&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* a process of collecting facts is commenced. These
are at first of the most homely kind, but the sphere from which they
are gathered is extended by degrees. We may, therefore, consider that
this collecting of facts is the earliest indication of the action of the brain,
and it is an operation which, with more or less activity, continues through
life.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Soon a second characteristic appears. The learning
of the relationship of the facts thus acquired to one another.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
This stage has been sometimes spoken of as the dawn of the reasoning
faculty. A third characteristic of almost contemporaneous appearance
may be remarked—it is the putting to use facts that have been acquired
and the relationships that have been determined.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Now this
triple natural process&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* must be the basis of any right system
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>of instruction. It appears, then, that contact and constant intercourse
with external manifestations is not only necessary for the production of
thought and its collaterals, but that to retain the consciousness which
makes thought possible such manifestations must be continuously impressed
upon the individual. This seems to be conclusive that mind
is the result of the experiences of the manifestations of power.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is still more subtle evidence that thought, which is only the
memory of past manifestations of power, or deduction of reason upon
them, is the product of material action. All mental action depends
upon the nervous apparatus, and is limited by its capacity. The activity
and power of this apparatus is in a great measure dependent upon
the quantity of phosphorus supplied to it, and this varies at different
periods of life.</p>

<p class='c008'>The point in question is further sustained by the fact that the rapidity
of thought varies with the supply of blood to the brain. Reduce
the action of the heart to forty beats per minute, and a feeling of languor
permeates the whole system. On the other hand, excess of cerebral
circulation results in excitement amounting sometimes to actual
delirium. We must, then, either admit that mental action is a product
of material power, and consequently itself material, or else conclude
that, while it is the result of the expenditure of power, it is in its character
immaterial, which would be absurd, because it is impossible to represent
immateriality in thought, as consciousness requires a subjective
action and objective reception of it to complete a thought, while immateriality
is neither.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not only is mental action affected by the quantity of blood supplied
to the brain, but also by its quality. This is fully shown in the
progress of certain diseases that prevent its being properly oxygenized,
and even more conspicuously in the administration of anæsthetics. A
similar effect can be produced upon the brain by deep, full and continuously
rapid breathing, by which an undue amount of oxygen is introduced
into the circulation.</p>

<p class='c008'>It appears, then, that having a perfect nervous apparatus, certain
special materials must be supplied to it from or by which to manufacture
mental and nervous action. Excessive mental action and powerful
and continuous emotions produce, as everybody knows, physical
prostration. From whatever position, then, we may view any action
the physical, mental or nervous system is capable of producing, we
come finally to the conclusion that they are possible only as the result
of the expenditure of some physical power, and every mind that will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>justly consider the evidence must give its adhesion to what science is
rapidly making plain.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before closing the consideration of thought another phase of its
manifestations demands attention. Who has not observed the effect of
one or two minds concentrated upon another person unconscious of the
intention? The object of such concentration becomes conscious of the
fact, and invariably, though involuntarily, looks in the direction whence
the influence proceeds. Before following this to its legitimate deductions
it must be taken for granted that there is an individual existence
after the dissolution of the physical body. Nearly all people accept
this as a part of consciousness. From two propositions already received
and well understood, a third may be deduced, and along with
it will follow such legitimate additional thoughts, ideas, impressions,
and modifications of former ones, as such deductions necessarily imply.
But how shall those thoughts not derived from anything already in consciousness,
be accounted for? And are not all conscious of receiving
many such thoughts in passive conditions and during sleep? Following
up the truth that something cannot be produced from nothing, the
source of these must be found, else our premises are false or incomplete.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every variety of mental action can be communicated. Given a
mind possessed of a new truth and one that has not yet perceived it,
the former can communicate it to the latter. This communication and
reception have been effected through the medium of speech. Another
method is through written or printed language. All this is simply symbolic.
Sounds and written or printed forms are in themselves nothing
but motion in the atmosphere and material formations by common consent
accepted to represent other and previous material formations. The
one thing of primary importance is, that the symbols used must be previously
understood by both parties to represent identical things at all
times. Thought, expressed in an unknown language, is not comprehended;
this indicates that thought abstracted from form is never communicated.
It cannot rise into consciousness even, except through an
established form. Capability of thought is only possible as the result
of constant contact with external manifestations, systematized under
certain regular and received forms which always remain purely symbolic.</p>

<p class='c008'>It remains to be considered how mind affects mind, through the
concentration of the will, without the apparent use of the above methods
of communication. We have seen that sounds produce an effect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>upon the object through the sense of hearing. But can you analyze
hearing, and show how the sounds rise into consciousness? When
forms are used an effect is produced through vision. But how does
vision rise into consciousness? We have seen that an effect is produced
by a concentration of the mind upon an object, but how this effect rises
into consciousness is beyond our comprehension.</p>

<p class='c008'>We can now proceed to the application of what has been offered,
to the communication between minds by other methods than
sound and form. Whence all these thoughts and impressions that steal
into consciousness through no apparent form? The conclusion seems
inevitable that mind can influence mind, whether it be within a physical
organization or out of it. We predicate, therefore, that all thoughts,
ideas, impressions, and sensations not coming from present external
manifestations nor from previously acquired facts, nor yet from direct
communications through recognized symbols, are emanations received
from some unknown mind either in or out of the physical form. Nor
can we escape from this conclusion, unless we concede that this case
forms an exception to the general law. All forms, then, of thought,
emotion and sensation are the legitimate result of the expenditure of
power, and may be arrayed in support of the premises that Life, Power,
and Motion, wherever found, are Unitary.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us consider in continuation, what application this unity has as
the basis of physical life. What constitutes this basis? Is physical
life the direct effect of the edict of a God reigning over the whole universe
from some unknown point within it? No, the theory of a
special Providence is fast giving place to new and better things—to law
and order. It is beginning to dawn upon mankind that “the only true
God” must be beyond our comprehension as the universe is, and that
it is folly or presumptive egotism to assert that God is this or that. A
God possessing such inconsistent infinite powers as are usually ascribed
to him, is fast being discarded by all thinkers. Therefore the basis
must be sought elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c008'>The universe is ruled in uniform ways. Special enactments for
special contingencies are inconsistent with our conception of the nature
of that general law by which all is governed. This alone is inferable,
when viewed with the conclusions previously arrived at, that things of
which we can be conscious are unitary in origin and in ultimate effect.
Supreme rule is removed beyond the pale of vicissitudes of time and
circumstance. The deduction, then, is that the cause of physical life is
universally the same, the manifestations being varied according to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>properties involved in them. Does life then consist of anything more
than this uniform Basis Power?</p>

<p class='c008'>The world of mind demands facts, not theories. Truth is no longer
feared, no matter how terribly it may shock the sensibilities of the religiously-educated
and philosophically-dwarfed intellect. Let us have
truth, then, even if it strips away the last of our preconceived opinions.
The cry for more light continues to extend. You who cannot yet endure
its brightness hide yourselves behind clouded dogmas, creeds and
theories. We know no creed but that which declares that an infinite,
inscrutable Power is the life of all things, material and spiritual; we
know no dogma save that life is the operation of this Power; we know
no theory but that which makes clear the laws and modes by which
these operations are governed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Discarding, then, all dogmas, the growing minds strikes boldly out
for truth, and he who catches but faint glimpses of it badly performs
his duty if he attempts to hide it from his brothers. If in its attainment
the Church crumbles, why falter? If governments totter, why
falter? Whatever will be crushed out by new discoveries and publication
of truth has already performed its mission. Suppose, for example, that
the grossest materialism ever conceived of was absolutely true, would
it not be best that the world should be convinced of its truth? It
speaks little for any system of religion or philosophy that it cannot bear
the light of facts, but evades, shuts out, or hurls anathemas at that
which it cannot refute. Such a course stands condemned before the
tribunal of a progressive philosophy. The very effort of a late institution
in opposition to physical freedom precipitated upon it its own destruction;
such will doubtless be the result of an attempt now being made
by a powerful institution to rivet religious bondage upon its subjects.</p>

<p class='c008'>In continuing this subject, extracts will be made from Prof. Huxley’s
lecture, “The New Theory of Life, or Matter the Basis of Vitality,”
to show that science has demonstrated that “life” is the same
everywhere; and though he disclaims materialistic philosophy, the tendency
of these extracts is in that direction. While matter must be
looked to for all expression of facts, it must not be overlooked that
the realm of power or spirituality is the producing cause; consequently,
while allowing science full scope in analyzing, demonstrating
and systematizing facts, religion must not be despoiled of its basis
idea which remains immovably fixed in consciousness. The Professor
says: “I have translated the term <i>Protoplasm</i>, which is the scientific
name of the substance I am about to speak of by the words ‘The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>Physical Basis of Life.’&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* To many, the idea
that there is such a thing as a physical basis or matter of life may
be novel.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Even those who are aware that matter
and life are inseparably connected may not be prepared for the conclusion
plainly suggested by the phrase ‘The Physical Basis of Life.’”
After giving various illustrations, drawn from nearly every department
of nature, grasping contrasts and dissimilarities, he adds: “I propose
to demonstrate that, notwithstanding these apparent difficulties, a three-fold
unity—a unity of power or faculty, a unity of form and a unity of
substantial composition, does pervade the whole living world;&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
that the complicated and multifarious activities of man are comprehensible
under three categories—either they are immediately directed
toward the maintenance and development of the body, or they are to
effect transitory changes in the relative positions of parts of the body;
or they tend toward the continuance of the species. Even the manifestation
of intellect, of feeling and of will, are not excluded from the
classification.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Prof. Huxley then illustrates the action of the <i>protoplasm</i> in the
common nettle and in the drop of blood, showing that both plants and
animals have their origin in a particle of nucleated <i>protoplasm</i>, and
that this <i>protoplasm</i> “not only dies and is resolved into its mineral and
lifeless constituents, but is always dying, and strange as the paradox
may seem, could not live unless it died.” Thus we are led to the conclusion
that all matter has a common basic principle by which we
obtain our evidences of it. It is equally clear that analysis fails to
grapple this principle, for the process dissipates the power that compelled
the combination. Dead <i>protoplasm</i> differs from living in that
something has departed from it, and though we cannot catch this to
decide upon its nature, can we with consistency say it is a property of
matter? If it is, what has become of it that it does not manifest itself
again upon the recombination of the matter it once made use of?
One fact is evident, and seems to be conclusive. This life principle
never manifests itself through artificial combinations of matter. Again,
is there no difference between ordinary matter and “matter of life?”
What changes the former into the latter, and <i>vice versa</i>? If chemical
analysis can tell us nothing about the composition of living matter,
what can it tell us of life itself? If nucleated <i>protoplasm</i> is the basis
of all life, and yet nothing but matter, why does one “structural unit”
of it produce a plant, another an animal? While it is evident that
the material composition of these units is uniform, it seems to be quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>absurd to say that chemical analysis teaches everything that they comprehend.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the manifestations of matter are the result of its properties, the
law must be of general application. Water always seeks its level: is
that a property of water or the result of gravitation? Water can be
expanded into vapor: is this a property of water or the result of the
introduction of heat? Is it a property of matter that transfers the digestible
and animal food we eat into man? Does man exhibit nothing
but the properties of matter? It is evident that after the strictest
chemical analysis the vital life principle common to all matter remains
unreached—thus indicating its great ultimate character, which
is beyond the reach of both chemical and mental analysis.</p>

<p class='c008'>What is this power by which the nucleated <i>protoplasm</i> of the
various species always produces representatives of the one which furnished
the germ? If it were simply a property of nucleated <i>protoplasm</i>,
considered as matter, why should not a germ from the lion
just as readily produce a lamb? In the various crosses between animals,
the aggregated masses of <i>protoplasm</i> partaking of both, the inference
plainly is that in each of the particles of <i>protoplasm</i> was contained
a power which controlled their successive aggregations and modifications.
Other evidence that the determining power is something more
than a mere property of matter is found in the fact that if the young
of several different species of animals be reared in company and fed
with the same material, they will each retain the peculiarities of the
species they represent, modified somewhat by the community of influence
exerted on them. The same is true of the offspring of different
races and nations.</p>

<p class='c008'>The law indicated is still more generally applicable, descending as
it does from the wide range of species and nations to each individual
member thereof. Upon different individuals the same cause, acting
under like circumstances, produces different effects, and this difference
is dependent upon something more persistent than matter which is
constantly changing. Is this persistent individuality a property of the
matter we possess now, or of that which we shall be made up of some
years hence? The consciousness of each one answers that this individuality
is superior to the vicissitudes of matter—this consciousness
having this peculiarity over its consciousness of the manifestations of
matter, that while it constantly acquires new experiences it loses none
of those previously acquired.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>We know nothing of this power, except that it is a name for an
unknown cause: and so far as practical utility is concerned, the distinction
between power and matter might be discarded, the danger of
falling thereby into the slough of materialistic philosophy being avoided,
if we remember that all the knowledge we can acquire is simply relative
and symbolic.</p>

<p class='c008'>Returning for a moment to the fact of reproduction, to ascertain if
possible the determining power by which one “structural unit” of nucleated
protoplasm develops into a beast, and another chemically identical
into a man, and realizing fully that this power is beyond common
modes of proof we infer that a reasonable conclusion can only be deduced
from observing the general unchanging law of the constant recurrence
of similar results under similar circumstances. The first step
in the inquiry is to ask what “protoplasm” is, and how and where it
is obtained.</p>

<p class='c008'>Prof. Huxley informs us that its chemical constituents are carbon,
hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen, which form carbonic acid, water and
ammonia; and that these are compounded by plants into the “matter
of life” or protoplasm, which is the first compound of elements possessing
inherent organic motion. This being the only way protoplasm can
be produced, we must always look to the vegetable world for continuous
supplies of it; and though we obtain it in large quantities from the
animal world, it is only at second-hand. In the vegetable world, then,
must we find the first traces of organic life. But though plants thus
manufacture protoplasm, they are not wholly protoplasm, but consist
of various other elements necessary in an organized form. The manufacture
of protoplasm may be considered the end of the vegetable world.
This substance builds up the animal world, and forms a connecting link
between the kingdoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>How long it took protoplasm to produce its ultimate animal man
we cannot ascertain, but the numerous species and varieties thereof between
the simplest and most complete compounds signify a labor of
which we can scarcely conceive, and yet science has traced and classified
it all, each succeeding link in the chain being a little more complex,
until man appears. As no higher types have been produced it is fair
to presume that none can be. The formula, then, that will present man
will include everything below him in the order of creation, not only in
the animal and vegetable kingdoms, but in the inorganic world upon
which the vegetable is founded.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>It remains to be observed that in the order of nature each of the
various species of animals reproduces its kind, and gradually merges
into the next higher, but never recedes. Each species represents in
different proportions and numbers the “structural units,” from which,
reproduction follows, each unit containing the life principle representative
of the general life principle of the animal from which it comes.
Now, it is predicated as a result of the study of nature that this
life principle is the determining power that controls the process
whereby protoplasm builds up such various and dissimilar material
reforms. Dead protoplasm consists of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
and nitrogen; living protoplasm, of these permeated and held together
by this life principle, and this differs in its controlling power according
to the formations it has gone through. Thus the “structural unit” of
the lion or of the horse, containing the life principle peculiar to each,
develops into a lion or a horse, as the case may be, unless in this process
it is furnished with living protoplasm containing a life principle of
different determining powers, when the aggregate result is a modification
of the two powers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, if the phenomena presented by matter are its absolute properties,
the same elements and combinations should always produce identical
results when taken into the human system. Do facts coincide
with this? This “matter of life” should, if it is simply matter, always
produce similar effects from whatever source it is derived. It is a physiological
fact, however, that habitual living upon certain kinds of food—all
containing this identical “matter of life”—does produce heterogeneous
effects, mental and physical, upon the system. Thus, if a person
who has constantly lived upon animal food changes his diet entirely
to fruit and vegetables, a corresponding change will take place in his
individual capacities.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same point is well illustrated by a case which occurred in
England, where saltpetre, obtained direct from the soil, was quite inert
compared with that obtained from animal substances, the cause of the
difference being due to the tact that the latter, in passing through the
animal kingdom, had acquired a power which it did not previously
possess. This illustration is of general application. It is evident that
matter, in passing through each successive and higher organic form,
becomes impregnated with the life principle which determines such
form, and which manifests itself in all future combinations into which
such matter enters.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>The question now naturally arises, Is there a life principle common
to all matter, which has become variously modified as the elements of
matter have become modified by having given rise to or passed
through the different changes and steps between its original homogeneous
state and its present heterogeneous condition? Or are we to conclude
that all matter is dead, except that termed “matter of life?”
That there is, consequently, no life except organic life, and that this
organic life is a special creation entering into a single compound, which
thereby raised to the dignity of “matter of life,” makes use of other
elements as auxiliaries to its supreme rule? With all proper deference
to “matter of life,” we would ask, what do we know of life except as
a result of motion? and where can matter be found that does not manifest
motion? and how could the compound in which the “matter of
life” is first found, have been compounded without motion? If the
life principle, manifested by protoplasm, is simply a property of matter,
I see no logical reason why the motion existing in matter should not
with equal propriety be called its property. This brings us to first
principles, to the threshold of elemental combination, for if this power
determines the forms compounds shall assume, why should it not determine
simple elemental form also?</p>

<p class='c008'>Protoplasm is the foundation of all organic life; and if we add
to this that this substance is itself the ultimate of a previous system of
formation, the formula will express the whole. Yet it must not be forgotten
that the building up of organic life is the result of a constructive
power common to the universe, and not indigenous to protoplasm alone.
It must then be apparent that there is a power common to all matter,
of which the motion or life inherent in living protoplasm is but a modification;
also, that the capacity of this common power for modification
is only limited by the necessary forms to represent it, and the time required
to develop them.</p>

<p class='c008'>If this view of the power that pervades the universe is correct, the
real basis of life lies retrospectively far behind the motion contained in
or manifested by the matter of life, and this motion, instead of being
life of matter in its absolute sense, is but one of its modes of expression.
This homogeneous power common to matter still exists, undisturbed in
extent, though most heterogeneously distributed in the formations which
make up the present external universe.</p>

<p class='c008'>The basis of physical life, then, is this power, and this power is the
same that was found to be unitary, though incomprehensible in its extent,
while its manifestations are simply symbolic of that unlimited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>power which is alone attributable to the Unknowable, commonly designated
God. If this conclusion is not in accordance with the modes of
manifestation, there is no halting-place between it and the opposite
extreme of the materialist that “there is no God”—that matter is all
there is in the universe. If materialistic philosophy involve “grave
error,” it becomes the duty of all who detect this tendency to preserve
and point out the distinctions between the “matter of life” and the
life of matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the true province of philosophy is to discern the “soul of truth,”
said to exist “in all erroneous things,” it ill becomes the ultra Spiritualist
with a “soul of truth,” contained within his vast body of errors,
to denounce the ultra Materialist, who, if he has not the “soul of truth,”
has a vast body of it. To the superficial thinker, the Materialist may
seem to be the more consistent of the two, as he can in part comprehend
his truth, while the Spiritualist cannot. Whether one is more or
less consistent than the other matters not, so far as their predications
are concerned.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the ultra Spiritualist would show his consistency by descending
to the plane of the Materialist to find in his “body of truths” evidences
of the handiwork of his God, which his ultra religious ideas fail
to furnish; and the ultra Materialist would show his by ascending to
the plane of the Spiritualist to find in his “soul of truth” the key that
shall transform his “body of truth” into living evidence of an unlimited
Power entirely beyond the pale of matter or the keenest scientific
analysis.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. I.</h3>

<p class='c011'>It is eminently proper, before approaching the future of any subject,
to make strictest inquiry and most diligent search in and around its
present—to look with retrospective glance upon the convergent paths
of the past that have led to its present, and to catch the indices pointing
onward; and, having found them, to judge whether such as Time’s
unfolding calendar has left here and there along the pathway of passing
events were reliable prophecies of what was to come—were truthful indications
of what was to follow. In the judgment determined and
warranted by the evidences obtained, a certain basis may be found
upon which to predicate the prophecies of the living present.</p>

<p class='c008'>The existing present is the absolute result of the eternal past; the
sum total of all that has gone before; the product of God’s everlasting
workings, by and through unchangeable law upon the elemental material
universe; nor can there be extracted from this result, this sum
total, this product, one simple separate effect which is not the legitimate
offspring of the operation of immutable law, co-extensive with the universe,
and co-existent with God.</p>

<p class='c008'>A proposition that there are powers within God’s realm which did
not spring from Him, or that the Original Cause has, in the economy of
Nature, found it necessary to amend and change the original law, in
order to accomplish His original purpose, or that contingencies have
arisen which have demanded special enactments on the part of the Divine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Ruler, presupposes that God did not know the end from the beginning,
or, knowing it, was incompetent to provide therefor. Such a
proposition, entertained by the human mind, destroys within it the God
of the universe, and leaves the world, to it, a mere toy in the hands of
its master, subject, at all times, to the caprices of his infinite rule, to be
led here and there by circumstances he knew not of previous to their
external development.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be said, that reasoning upon the character of God’s government,
or the mode through which he manifests himself to the world,
is not pertinent to the subject in view; to those who think thus the
query should be propounded—What of the <i>future</i> without a reliable
present? and what of the effects that must follow, if the operating, existing
general laws of the universe be not the same in a thousand years
as now? It becomes, then, extremely important that some permanent,
unchangeable basis be found before proceeding to predicate the future;
and unless God is the same yesterday, to-day and forever, we can find
no certain basis upon which to stand and from which we can start.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have but to question the earth whether or not, from its incipiency
onward through countless ages, it has obeyed the one great command,
Progress? and in answer received, determine if, in the past, God has
found it necessary to change the great fundamental laws of the universe.
Geology tells in unmistakable writings what the earth was; we
have but to look about us to see what it is. At no time since <i>it was</i> can
we learn that the law of progressive unfoldment has been inverted, and
the world turned backward toward its commencing point. Since this
has not occurred in the past, we may safely assume that it will not occur
in the future; the law of progress may be accepted as one of God’s
immutable decrees. The universe to-day, in all its variety and beauty,
is no more in essence than it was millions of years ago, when it first assumed
its orbital movements; the same elements exist in the exact
quantity—nothing added—nothing taken away. Progress is simply a
new arrangement of elementary principles.</p>

<p class='c008'>Simple elements are indestructible; when two or more are combined,
and produce an effect, the combination may be destroyed, and
the elements separated and returned to their natural condition. This
process is not one of destruction, but simply of change of the relations
of the elements that formed the combination. An acorn
deposited in the earth attracts to itself such elements as produce growth;
after years of labor, the mighty oak is the result. Although in its formation
it has taken from the earth and air certain properties, the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>quantity of such proportions still exists—nothing new has been created,
a new form only has been produced by Nature, testifying that she
never rests. Now, suppose a power were applied to the oak to dissolve
it, the oak only would be destroyed, not the properties that entered into
its composition.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is supposed there are a certain number of elementary principles
contained in and that make up the material universe; were these principles
simple units, incapable of divisibility, we could, by applying the
rule of geometrical progression, soon arrive at the exact number of different
combinations, and consequently the exact number of different
forms they are capable of producing; but, being infinite in quantity and
divisibility, infinitude of form and effect is possible. The power of arrangement
being infinite, infinitude of association and combination is
the legitimate result.</p>

<p class='c008'>Combination and association began in the simplest forms! When
God, by his omnipotent voice, spoke the earth into existence, as an individual
planet, it contained exactly the same elements of which it is
now composed; but they were simply in elemental form, without organization,
and, consequently, without variety of manifestation in form;
motion being an inherent quality, constant agitation brought the elements
into relations and combinations, simple at first; but by constant
change they arose from the simple to the complex, and from the complex
toward the infinite, and in the sum total of them we have the living
present.</p>

<p class='c008'>The argument does not require that minute examination of geological
science be made, following, one by one, the rise and fall, the organization
and destruction of each of its classified periods, nor of the
specific results by and through each; but only to recognize <i>the law</i> by
which these results are arrived at. It is possible to so trace and classify
these results as to show a continuous chain of progression, link by
link, from the simplest form of combination, to the most complex and
perfect, wherein all the original elements were first represented—man!
Having arrived at perfection of form, wherein all the properties of the
material world find themselves forming a part, it might reasonably be
accepted that progression in formation would cease; while it has ceased
so far as producing higher types is concerned, it has not in the quality
of the types already produced; and in this proposition lies the greatest
problem of life; the one most difficult for the human mind to grasp.
Man, representing in form all that has gone before, is the result of the
grand chain of progressive material formations; and, having combined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>within his physical form a portion of every element contained in the
world, he may be likened in his infancy to the infancy of the earth.
God, in spirit, pervades all material nature, and the union—if union it
may be called—forms a perfect whole, and man being an epitome of all
things contained in the material world, receives into his organization
the spirit of each of its representative constituent parts, and consequently
is endowed with all the spiritual attributes of the universe, the attributes
of God! and, as God is eternal, man, created in His image, must
likewise be eternal.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the earth, in its first efforts at organization, combined but few
of its principles, and presented the crudest form, and as time rolled on
and its combinations continued to include more and more of the several
principles, so with man; in his infancy his spiritual manifestations were
crude in the extreme, but there has constantly been brought into co-operative
combination, more and more of the spiritual principles, and
higher and higher types of spiritual manifestations have been the
result.</p>

<p class='c008'>If man, as a unit, were analyzed to-day, he would be found
to be made up spiritually of the elements corresponding to that
age of the development of the physical world of which he is now the
representative; that is to say, in his manifestations spiritually, he exhibits
the same ratio of spiritual elements that the earth did in her manifestations
in material elements at the time in her growth corresponding
with the present condition and growth of man.</p>

<p class='c008'>If cool and deliberate reason, unbiased by mythological and theoretical
dogmas, be applied to the correspondence between the material
and spiritual elements, the conclusion can scarcely fail to be arrived at,
that each primary element of the material universe is the external expression
and representative of a spiritual attribute of God; and as there
are a definite number of elements in nature, forming the perfect <i>material
whole</i>, so there are an equal number of analagous spiritual elements that
constitute the <i>spiritual whole</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the elements and their corresponding interior principles are susceptible
of infinite combinations and associations, the varied manifestations
of nature and man are readily accounted for. Nor should it be
forgotten that each of the manifestations is the legitimate and inevitable
result of the combination out of which it springs; and, as the combination
is not self-creative, but the result of the action of progressive law,
so the effect of the combination is but the outward expression of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>purposes contained within the law, behind the formation of the combination,
and is thus the result of God’s operative law of progress.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having argued thus far to show that the <i>present age</i>, material, mental
and spiritual, is the legitimate result of the law of progressive development,
the following propositions are deduced therefrom, forming a basis
or platform from which to ask of the present—What of the future?
Whither doth it lead?</p>

<p class='c008'>First—All power, wherever manifested, is a unit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Second—God is the source of all power, and the elements the subject
of its application.</p>

<p class='c008'>Third—Each attribute of God has its corresponding material element.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fourth—All the material elements constitute the material world;
all the spiritual elements, God.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fifth—There is nothing contained in creation outside of the power
of God, on the one hand, and the elementary principles on the other—the
first positive, the last negative.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sixth—Nothing can be added to what was; nothing taken away
from what is.</p>

<p class='c008'>Seventh—All the diversities in nature are the legitimate effect of
the power of God, operating through and upon different elements, and
different proportions of different elements, contained in nature, the diversity
being infinite, because the material and producing power are
infinite.</p>

<p class='c008'>Eighth—Man, collectively, being the representative of all the material
and spiritual elements, the individual diversities observed in him
are the legitimate result of the different relative proportions of these
elements contained in his organization.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ninth—The present is the result of spiritual principles acting upon
and through the material elements during the eternal past.</p>

<p class='c008'>Giving a comprehensive glance at the world it will be seen that
<i>government</i> of some kind is everywhere established, which purports to
rule the people embraced within certain geographical boundaries. An
analysis of each form, from the crudest and most barbarous up through
all the modifications of civilized government, will discover that each
government was a true exponent of the character of the people by or
over whom it was established. Every country, as it advances in intellectual
and moral development, demands modifications in its government
adapted to the improved capacity of the people. Hence, as the
character of the governed progresses, so must that of the government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>keep pace with that of the governed, else the power behind it will rise
to its <i>might</i>, and <i>sweep it away</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is but little doubt that the government of this country is the
highest form now in existence on the earth; but to show how crude and
even barbarous it is, reference only has to be made to the terrible conflict
it has just survived, which became inevitable and necessary as the
only practical demonstration of the power of the principles upon which
it purports to have been founded—that all men are born free and equal,
and entitled to certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness. This proposition was made fundamental
by great and good men, the representative lights of the country at that
time, standing far in advance of the general mind. Liberty and equity
had burst upon their souls under the sway of tyranny and oppression,
which became so odious that anything was preferable to them, to longer
enduring its injustice. In this land, far removed from that where freedom
could not lift its head—with a mighty ocean rolling between, they
felt they had found a secure asylum from further oppression, and a land
where their new-born hopes could be realized. But, unfortunately,
all who came to the <i>New World</i> had not these hopes and anticipations;
some there were who still desired the strong hand of the tyrant to sway;
and, thus invoked, it reached even across the mighty deep, and sought
anew to enslave these new-born sons of freedom. Submission they
never thought of—resistance was their only theme; and most thoroughly
did they resist; through the long conflict that ensued, carried on by
them under every conceivable disadvantage, their hopes never completely
died out; and at last—triumphant over the crown—freedom
reigned!</p>

<p class='c008'>It cannot be wondered at that souls rising from such a conflict as
the Revolution, triumphant, should assert so broad a proposition in behalf
of equality as they did at the commencement of the struggle; nor is
it wonderful that the great majority of the people did not understand,
or did not have a full perception of the principle for which their representatives
periled their lives and fortunes and pledged their sacred
honor; but principles which were but partially discerned by the Fathers
of the Republic have now grown into rules of action enforced by
the sanctions of fundamental law; slavery of the body is no longer possible;
the verdict of the majority of the people proclaimed it “behind
the age.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The South, recognizing this fact, knew that separation from the
progressive mind of the North was the only chance for the continuance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>of a system which furnished so many excuses for physical, mental and
moral lethargy; and in their attempt to separate, they precipitated a
conflict in which history repeated itself, and freedom came out triumphant;
thus what sprung from the seeds of tyranny and oppression,
left scattered here and there by those who made that broad declaration,
have been finally uprooted, and never more can take root and flourish
under the scorching blaze of freedom’s noontide sun.</p>

<p class='c008'>That physical, mental and spiritual lethargy was the condition of
the South under the system of slavery all statistics touching this point
indisputably attest; and the verdict of fifty years will pronounce the
abolition of their system the greatest blessing God has yet vouchsafed
them; it has opened the door of progress for all things, material and
spiritual, and has rescued from the barbaric chains of the past a country
more favored by God, in the bestowal of natural advantages, than any
other on the face of the globe.</p>

<p class='c008'>The general love of freedom, because it is an inherent right, is one
of the first evidences the soul presents that it is growing from the boundaries
and control of the material, from which it sprang, into those of the
spiritual toward which it tends. When this love first takes root the
soul has attained that degree of development wherein the spiritual has
the superior control of the individual, resulting from the predominance
of the spiritual over the material.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fact that the general sentiment of the country demanded that
slavery should no longer exist within its boundaries, is a very significant
one, when considered in connection with the tendencies and prophecies
of the present; it shows that the capacity and desire for freedom
is being rapidly developed in the human soul; it indicates that the
mind begins to appreciate what freedom really guarantees to its votaries
in its broadest signification; it begins to recognize the glorious truth
that every soul will, sooner or later, demand and receive all its rights.</p>

<p class='c008'>The demands of public sentiment, which have already resulted in
modifications of the constitution of the country, will not stop at the door
of African slavery, which it has thrown wide open; there are many
other systems of slavery still left to be abolished; while they do not
all enslave the body, they so fetter the soul and the mind, that their influence
is even more pernicious and galling than the enslavement of the
body.</p>

<p class='c008'>The African slave, toiling under the burning sun in the cotton,
rice and sugar plantations of the South, was virtually in possession of
more freedom of soul than are many of the white race, even in our own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>midst. Look into these things, and see if, while you have “cast the
mote out of your brother’s eye,” you have not a “<i>beam</i>” in your own;
these, however numerous, will in turn and time demand of the people
and of the government, when in its province, such attention as may be
required to extend freedom in all directions where “life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness” legitimately lead.</p>

<p class='c008'>The history of the past as well as the tendencies of the present
prophecy with distinctness and positiveness that the demand will soon
go out, not only for a government founded on equal rights to all, but
whose laws shall be administered with justice and equity, guaranteeing
freedom of body, mind and soul to every living intelligence.</p>

<p class='c008'>From evidences rapidly accumulating, it is believed that this country
is ripening for such a form and administration of government; but
in the present condition of society and of servitude to its customs, the
imperfect and partial manner of arriving at representation, and of making
and administering law, such a reform cannot be inaugurated; that
is to say, although such a reform would be acceptable to and welcomed
by the country, and will soon be demanded by it, as yet it is impossible
to organize an effort, strictly within itself, that could effect it, because
there is not a sufficient concentration of understanding upon the requirements
to be met, nor of wisdom enough to draft for these requirements
adequate laws and forms of administration. Were such a code prepared
and submitted to the people, do you think it would be rejected?</p>

<p class='c008'>In the earlier days of the republic legislation seems to have been
conducted upon constitutional principles; but in these latter days it has
so far departed from its seeming mainsprings of action that it is safe to
assert that legislation, founded strictly upon considerations of principles
of justice and right, is unknown in the land. If sometimes a great principle
is demonstrated through legislation, it will invariably be found
upon strict investigation, that the legislation was not predicated upon
the principle, but upon some personal or party benefit expected to flow
therefrom; the <i>principle</i>, therefore, stands under obligation to the expected
benefit, and to the party <i>needing</i> it, and will doubtless, in its impartial
operations, <i>remember</i> them. While this condition is a perfectly
legitimate one, flowing from adequate producing causes, there are individual
minds and souls, by thousands, who rise in their capacities for government
out of it, and demand reform and the essential truth of Principle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Government may be compared to an individual who, having committed
some infringement upon the law of justice, is impelled, by the
position it forces him into, to continue the practice to sustain himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>from falling; but as a system of injustice cannot be perpetual, fail he
must, sooner or later; and the longer it is delayed, the more complete
will be the wreck and ruin when it comes;—as with the individual, so it
must be with the State. Once started upon a system of law-making
and executing not founded upon principles of justice and right, the
course must be pursued and sustained by further enactments, either to
<i>cover</i> the deformities of the previous proceeding or <i>hide</i> its purposes,
and unless righteous judgment come to the rescue before the course has
led to wide-spread and apparent corruption throughout all its channels
of administration, it must eventually culminate in the downfall of the
government, if not in the destruction of the nation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Policy, not principle, is the ruling power behind all present legislation.
Policy, inevitably and indiscriminately, leads to corruption. Corruption,
obeying the inherent laws of its own nature, untouched by and beyond
the control of the enactments that first gave it life and afterward fostered
its growth, must culminate in certain destruction to all parts involved,
whether it be within the body human, the body corporate or
the body politic.</p>

<p class='c008'>Did the Republican party, as a party, desire the freedom of the
negro simply and solely because it was one of his natural rights? Would
freedom have been extended to him by that party had it been
positively known that all his influence would be used against it?
Or would the Democratic party, as a party, have opposed the enfranchisement
of the negro had it been known that he would become its
political ally?</p>

<p class='c008'>Judging from the indices of the past, it is fair to suspect, at least,
if not to conclude, that the Republican party is expecting another such
exigency as existed when it was found politic to extend freedom and
suffrage to the negro; and in the question of female suffrage, for which
the demand is now being earnestly made, there is but little doubt that
it sees another means of salvation in the future, and seeks to postpone
the question until the exigency shall become more imminent and dangerous.
It may be argued that the Republican party was organized
upon the principles of freedom. If this were wholly true, it would be
also true that it had no sooner become a party in power than it resolved
itself into a tribunal to define the limits for the application of the very
principles that had placed it in power; thereby endeavoring to prostitute
the principle to subserviency to the policy of its leaders, instead of
calmly and firmly following where it would legitimately lead; like all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>parties and sects, of previous origin, it built upon a principle, and then,
instead of wisely following, recklessly attempted to guide it.</p>

<p class='c008'>With all the prestige of possession, and of being the acknowledged
representative of the principle which had carried it into power, the result
of the late elections began to be feared by the party, because its
leaders knew they had driven it from its birthright, and led it after
strange gods; and, had the opposing party been actuated by true progressive
principles of justice, no man, however popular in himself, could
have saved it from destruction.</p>

<p class='c008'>Conscious of having departed from the principles that gave it
power, the Republican party is even now seeking every means within
its grasp to fortify itself behind measures looking solely to success in
’72; but it is prophesied that ere that time there will have sprung into
existence another party that will not be the mere professed representative
of freedom and equal rights to all, but the actual, living, moving,
irresistible incarnation of those principles.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lines of policy pursued by party leaders, and the channels of
corruption opened by the executive officers of the government, have
produced a result so wide-spread in its influence and ramifications that,
instead of their being under the control of the government, they exert
a vast if not controlling power over all its actions; it is not necessary
to go beyond its own records to establish this fact; every newspaper in
the country teems with evidence in point; the clergy have deemed the
situation dangerous enough to hurl the anathemas of the Church against
it; the dramatist and the artist, the poet and the philosopher, have each
dealt his blow, while the “toiling millions” everywhere cry for reform.</p>

<p class='c008'>So general and earnest has the demand for reform become that
something must be done; the gathering masses of corruption all over
the body will soon have ripened to bursting; and who can tell how
much the body itself has become involved. May it not be feared that
it does not possess sufficient recuperative purity and strength to stand
the shock? Could the enlightened mental, moral and spiritual elements
of the country which are possessed by those who stand in the front ranks
of the advancing column of progress be combined into organized action,
they might be able to arrest the abnormal growth of corruption, and,
by strengthening and stimulating the sound members of the body to
co-operative action, restore the whole system to its normal condition.</p>

<p class='c008'>The machinery of the government has become so complex and unwieldy—so
full of departmental and petty offices—that it is utterly beyond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>the power of one man, though he be “<i>a great and mighty</i> President,” to
understand and control it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tendencies of the government being dangerous to the liberties
of the people, their demand for reform is earnest, and must be heeded.
But where will reformation begin? To whom must we look for relief?
If we go to Congress with the Constitution in our hands, and demand
such legislation as would give practical efficiency to the preamble and
charter of freedom, they may possibly pay sufficient attention to the
subject to pass a joint resolution setting forth that, while certain inalienable
rights seem to be guaranteed to all, still Congress must be the dispensing
power and judge of its application; and that it has decided
that the negro shall be the first on the list—next, perhaps, the Indian
may come in—next the Chinaman, and all the ends of the earth—except
woman. Yes, go to Congress for relief from onerous taxes, wrung
from the blood and bones of the laboring poor to fill the coffers of government
vampires, and they will answer you by passing some new
<i>Revenue Act</i>, in whose cunningly prepared articles will be found traps
set for the people’s money, which the trained bands of political party
secretly manage on joint account for themselves and their party leaders;
it will answer you by granting new subsidies to corporations already
grown rich from the fruits of the labor of the people; by granting to
powerful monopolies still further privileges increasing their power
through bribery and corruption to make subordinate the welfare of the
country to their own selfish purposes, and by favoring all schemes for
the <i>centralization of power</i>. Such being the answers to your demands,
there is still a tribunal to which you can appeal, which in all time past
has heard and answered the <i>demands of the age</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the system of <i>special</i> and <i>class</i> legislation causes of corruption
and the downfall of governments may always be found; it is the bane
of the nations, whence flows that subtle, entrancing poison that permeates
all the arteries and veins of a country—so quietly and alluringly to
the people, that, before its effects are suspected, the vital principle of
the government is destroyed, and the lifeless form finally falls to rise
no more forever; or, if the spiritless form be still upheld by the usurper,
it is only retained as “a cheat and a delusion” to shield the person of
the tyrant who has enslaved his victims in the name and under the
guise of liberty.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. II.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The subject of government and the solution of all its difficulties
seem to hinge upon the question, Where does God’s government drop
its sway (if it does so at all), and where does man take it up, on his own
account, by inherent natural right, guaranteed to him by the law that
gave him being? The only modification of this question required to
be considered is, How far man is or can be the authorized, competent
agent of the Almighty in working out His purposes? To solve all
these questions it becomes necessary to determine what the fundamental
principles of government must be, to be in harmony with the laws of
God, and to adopt them and to follow them out to all their legitimate
conclusions and results, discarding everything else. In such government
and legislation the eternal principles of right, which are God’s
laws, are in full force and effect, and <i>man</i>, thus far, an authorized competent
agent in the administration of His decrees in the material world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whether a government founded or administered upon any other
basis than the eternal principles of right and justice can or cannot be
enduring, is a proposition the simplest mind may solve. Progress is
from the lower to the higher; in its certain and irresistible march all
systems and things that have risen out of the circumstances of the times
to which they belong will be swept away to make room for the new
and the better; but principles and self-evident truths that were contained
in such systems will endure to be incorporated into all future systems.</p>

<p class='c008'>There can be no higher form of expression than that life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness are “<i>inalienable</i>” rights to <i>all</i>; and, being
such, it is safe to assume that it will always remain as a fundamental
proposition in the organic law of this country; and legislation will be
required to guide itself by it, instead of being its exponent.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>Change upon change will come in the future, as it has in the past,
until government will become so simplified as to have for its foundation
nothing but an annunciation of general principles of justice and
equity, as self-evident truths upon which all legislation must be based.</p>

<p class='c008'>Passing, for a time, the consideration of the principles of government,
it may be well to inquire into the injustice of some of its present
details. All men, and women, too, are <i>born</i> free and equal, entitled to
certain natural rights, which no government has the right to take from
them. While every man and woman is a result of the general law of
procreation, there are distinguishing points peculiar to each, which renders
every <i>one</i> different from every <i>other</i>; thus no two persons can be
so precisely alike as to make their individuality the same; consequently
no two persons are governed by the same internal and external mainsprings
of action and influence. Let the same power and influence be
exerted upon different individuals, no matter how nearly they may
<i>resemble</i> each other, different results will flow from each, the character
of which will be absolutely determined by the status of the development
of, and the relations between the material, and spiritual elements
represented in the individuals acted upon. No argument is needed to
prove this proposition; and the legitimate deduction to be drawn from
it is, that no judgment of the action of the individual, by others, is just
that does not take into consideration all the various points in character
and influence under which action is produced.</p>

<p class='c008'>It must not be forgotten that all thought and action on the part
of an individual is the legitimate result of some competent producing
cause, operating by natural law. The cause being competent, the law
of operation natural, and the result consequently legitimate, can another’s
idea of right step in to sit in judgment over the action, and render a
verdict of justice to the actor? Or, can any number of individuals determine
what the demands of justice are which God himself has declared
by the mouth of all His holy prophets, material and spiritual. “Judgment
is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.”</p>

<p class='c008'>No one can hope to escape the judgments of the eternal law, or to
hide himself from God’s officers of justice; but must by them be
brought before its stern, undeviating bar, to receive its unpardonable
sentence. But, says the objector, this does not satisfy me, who have
suffered from the offence. What if it does not satisfy you? God is
satisfied; and are you greater than He, that you may question His justice?
If you are not yet satisfied, God will most surely satisfy you in
His own good time.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>Look into your statutes, and within them, find their own
stultification. They assert that no criminal shall be subjected to two
trials and penalties for the same offence; but, in the face of this righteous
rule, and with the positive knowledge that God has already tried,
convicted and sentenced the murderer, the courts of the country take
possession and control of the criminal, proceed to try, convict, condemn
and hang him by the neck until he is dead. Rest assured God will not
overlook this attempt of yours to forestall his judgments.</p>

<p class='c008'>We stop here to make a broad assertion: For man to affix certain
definite penalties as punishment for so-called crime is to arrogate to
himself what alone belongs to God!</p>

<p class='c008'>Stumbling-blocks are constantly found in the path of progress,
against which the earnest traveler finds himself precipitated; these consist
of the ideas of the past, clothed with form and expression, and
which were set up by their conceivers as “guides and lights” of their
times, for those who groped their way by such assistance. The earnest
seeker after light finds these set up all along his path, declaring “thus
far shalt thou go, and no farther;” but he, catching a glimpse of the
light so bright beyond, clears the obstruction by a single bound, and
goes on his way rejoicing, seldom deeming it his duty to turn upon and
cast what to him was but a hindrance from the path of progress, so that
others coming that way should not encounter it, who perhaps might
lack the power to surmount it. “Let your light shine” so that those
who come after you may be aided thereby.</p>

<p class='c008'>A single argument upon the question of the relations between
debtor and creditor, which is maintained by the present laws, will
be sufficient to illustrate the whole subject of customs, authorities and
laws, which are obstructions in the path of progress. The time was
when imprisonment for debt was authorized by law in all the States of
this land of freedom (?); but the spirit of progressive justice has been
at work until but few of the States now retain this libel upon Christian
civilization to disgrace their statutes. Imprisonment for debt! What
good ever resulted from it? The malignity of the creditor may have
satisfied itself by still further humiliating the broken spirits of the
debtor; but the creditor, by such action, places it still further
beyond the power of the unfortunate debtor to satisfy the demand.
It is asserted, without fear of successful contradiction, that the same
deleterious effects generally flow from all similar laws. All kinds of
crime are but species of debt, and the same rule applies with about the
same force to its laws and penalties. Imprisonment for debt has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>pretty generally abolished, but still our statute books are laden with
laws to enforce collection.</p>

<p class='c008'>A philosopher and economist, not long ago, fully investigated the
relations between debtor and creditor, and the practical results of the
laws now in force, and arrived at the “deliberate conclusion” that the
costs attending the attempts to collect debts by legal process were three
times the amount collected; not a very flattering commentary upon the
policy of the law, and certainly not a paying investment to the crediting
part of our community. This conclusion may at first thought appear
fallacious; but when the expensiveness of courts, and the immense incomes
of lawyers who practice at their bars, are considered, the afterthought
will fully sustain the conclusion. It is believed by many that
if there were no laws at all to enforce collection, there would be many
less <i>bad debts</i>; even now a debt of honor is held by public opinion to
have precedence of those which the <i>law</i> claims the right to enforce.</p>

<p class='c008'>The thinker of ordinary capacity will see at a glance that an immense
amount of labor would be withdrawn from the courts, which now
bears heavily upon the people, not only in the form of taxes to pay for
court-houses, jury-rooms and judges’ salaries, but in the waste of time
employed in jury-boxes by men dragged from their inevitable toil, and
held as prisoners, while their wives and children are often suffering,
and even dying, from the want of their care and attention at home.
Contracts should be so well defined as to admit of no misunderstanding;
and if there was no method of collection and enforcement, there would
be very many less disagreements; hence, in no light in which it can be
viewed, does our present system commend itself to the wisdom and justice
of the reflecting; on the contrary, it throws open the door for cunning
and knavery to enter to test their strength through technical evasions
and blind inferences, practiced, on the unwary and ignorant by the
“<i>Quirks</i>, the <i>Gammons</i> and the <i>Snaps</i>,” who, as <i>vampires</i> of the time-honored
profession they disgrace, feed and fatten upon the misfortunes
of the deluded, long-forbearing, long-suffering <i>children of toil</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be safely asserted that a very large part of <i>all law</i> contained
within the statutes of the world, when analyzed, will present about the
same deleterious results in practice and in the opportunities presented
for infringement and subsequent evasion of their penalties that inevitably
flow from all laws for the collection of debts.</p>

<p class='c008'>The time has probably not yet come for the abolishment of all such
laws, but the time has come when the relations of individual debtors
and creditors should be left to the control of general principles of justice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>which declare that a contract once fairly made, an obligation once
fairly incurred, can never be discharged until satisfaction shall have
been entered upon the record by divine justice.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. III.</h3>

<p class='c011'>When it is considered, how much the useful portion of life is dependent
upon the preparatory part, the character of the influences
brought to bear during that part, and the manner of their application,
become a subject of deep importance. Education has received the most
special attention from scholars, savants and professors; but they seem
to have forgotten or to have ignored the fact that within the mind is
contained the germ of all acquirements, and that teaching by rule
merely what others have said or written, cramps and dwarfs the mind
which, under a more natural system, would more rapidly and more
healthfully develop its latent powers, through its stimulated efforts to
evolve ideas connected with such facts and phenomena as may be exhibited
to it, and thus become a part of the mind itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of training the mind to rely upon method, books and authorities
as rules, it should be encouraged to form methods of its own.
The mind should be questioned, and its answers listened to, instead of
being furnished by the teacher.</p>

<p class='c008'>The mode proposed has many decided advantages. It inspires
self-reliance, disciplines the mind to think for itself, accustoms it to express
its own conclusions in its own chosen language, leads to clear and
comprehensive forms of expression, gives decision and confidence, and
tends to produce individuality of thought and character.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Children’s Progressive Lyceum, instituted upon this idea, has
already been inaugurated, and should receive the careful and unprejudiced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>attention of all interested in educational reform. Children who
have been under this system but a few months are able to stand before
an audience, and, in a clear and comprehensive manner, speak without
embarrassment upon any subject comprehended by their minds. The
coming generations will acknowledge a debt of gratitude to the founder
of this system which no depth of respect or reverence could fully express.</p>

<p class='c008'>No proposition can be made which will be more readily accepted
by the general progressive mind than that, as the world advances in
knowledge and wisdom, its general welfare becomes more and more
dependent upon reciprocal interests; that is to say, as <i>persons</i> and
<i>nations</i> become more and better individualized, their reliance upon interests
outside of themselves becomes more positively and distinctly
defined; thus a system of mutual dependence and reciprocal interests
is every day being more widely inaugurated, which will continue to
spread until the whole world will be brought into harmonious co-operation.
This is <i>commerce</i>! Commerce, to the material world, is what
thought is to the spiritual—interchange and exchange of material product
in the one and of spiritual in the other—hence no restrictions or
embargoes should be placed on the one which would not be legitimate
if placed upon the other. The dependence and independence of each
is mutual and general.</p>

<p class='c008'>Restrictions upon commerce is a system of commercial slavery,
flowing from <i>politic</i> and <i>special</i> legislation, and is in violation of the
eternal principles of right, because it renders equality in interchange
impossible. If it is the right principle to restrict commerce between
nations, it extends to States, to cities and to individuals as well.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under the rule of an unrestricted commercial intercourse throughout
the world, the principle of supply and demand would control the
movements of commerce without the aid of legislation; and, when once
fully established, it would give stability and security to production
everywhere. The products of the world entering into commerce would
localize themselves where they naturally belong—where most could be
produced with the least labor; and, population obeying the laws of
equalization, would adjust itself to the demands of the respective interests
of productive labor. This is a vast problem, in the solution of
which the whole world is vitally interested, and one which, sooner or
later, must be solved. If its solution were possible <i>now</i>, coming generations
would look back and bless us for the solving. An international
congress should be called to consider the subject, and to take proper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>measures for the inauguration of a system of general economy in production
and consumption. The prophecies of the age point to this as
a reform of sufficient magnitude to demand the immediate attention of the
nations, and to call for a <i>Christ</i> to rise up for their salvation more powerful
than the Democratic Party.</p>

<p class='c008'>The political, national or personal advantages which are supposed
to flow from restraints upon commerce, have nothing to do with the
question of general reform. While it is the duty of every nation and
every individual person to press forward the work of reform upon general
principles, each nation and person must always keep in view the
law of <i>self-preservation</i>, otherwise individuality will be lost in the struggle
for supremacy, which has hitherto characterized the legislation of
nations and the conduct of individual persons. The great principle of
unrestricted universal commerce can only be practically established by
universal acquiescence in its wisdom and justice. When legislation
shall conform itself to general principles, instead of sectional, local or
personal policy, and when its course shall be shaped by such broad action,
it may be safely prophesied that the government it represents will
be perfect and perpetual. Commerce will then obey the law of progress,
and rise from the petty policies of nations, which strangle its development
and limit its benefits: it will rise to be conducted upon the
dignity of principle, untrammeled by policy; and on this platform the
world will unite in harmonious prosperity under a universal government,
not limited even by the boundaries between the material and the
spiritual world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Underlying all advancement and prosperity, material and spiritual,
is action—motion—which, guided by intellect, results in <i>labor</i>, without
which the world would be as though man had never been; for no form
of creature below him has ever left permanent artificial beauty, systems
of economy or usefulness as the result of its workings, except in so far
as the form itself may be accounted such.</p>

<p class='c008'>What, in two hundred years, has so changed the face of this country
from the wilderness it was to the teeming garden it is, dotted all
over with the habitations of men? What has produced the floating
palaces that everywhere walk its deep waters “like a thing of life?”
What has united all its distant parts by iron bands, along whose guiding
lines those other representatives of <i>art</i> and <i>motion</i> speed, almost outstripping
the wind? What has overcome time and space, and is now
extending its arms to embrace the globe, that we may speak, and that
the ends of the earth answer our call? Marvelous demonstration of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>the rapidly growing mutual and reciprocal dependence of the children
of men! What has made the wilderness to blossom as the rose? What
has achieved all these glorious, god-like results? Labor! labor! labor!
physical, mental and spiritual labor!</p>

<p class='c008'>Labor, therefore, is the fulcrum of the great lever of progress, lifting
humanity from the material up to the spiritual realm. One short
century ago nearly all physical labor was performed by the hands of
man. Since then the mind has come up to the work, and rescued the
body from the laborious servitude of former times; and now a single
mind, directing a single machine, produces an hundred-fold more than
it could when acting through its own personal machine. The inventive
powers of the mind will continue to produce more labor-saving machines
until labor directly with the hand will be almost, perhaps entirely,
superseded.</p>

<p class='c008'>The products of the mind, when compared with purely physical
labor, are of inestimable value, and the great distinction everywhere
recognized in their relative compensations is still too limited. No argument
is needed to establish the dignity of labor; it has established
itself in becoming the architect of the great future, by building the past
and the present.</p>

<p class='c008'>Out of the multiform phases of labor, questions will arise which
will require for their adjustment equitable rules of compensation; the
best talent in the world can find ample scope for useful employment in
the solution of the numerous problems growing out of this vast subject.
<i>Labor</i>—physical, mental and spiritual—finding itself in a position of injustice,
is in a state of constant irritation and discontent, and legitimately
seeks redress through the organization of associations to control its
price; but it is at least questionable whether such combinations have
been productive of any permanently beneficial results. If it could be
perceived and comprehended, there must be, in the nature of things,
perfect and complete harmony in the practical operation of all the working
elements or agencies, not only in this world, but in the boundless
universe.</p>

<p class='c008'>This problem may find a practical solution in co-operative labor
associations, in which the members share equally the profits upon what
they produce.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suppose the entire labor of the country were conducted upon this
just principle, what would be the result? The rapidly accumulating
wealth of the country is the result of labor; if the united labor of the
country, producing this increase, should henceforward share it equally,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>the result, in time, would be the <i>equalization</i> of the wealth of the country,
which is now rapidly growing into a necessity, to modify the luxurious
habits of the rich on the one hand, and the crying evils of poverty
on the other, which are rapidly engendering an antagonism,
which will continue to increase in volume and intensity until it will
culminate in a storm that will consume the elements of discord in the
same manner (and upon the same immutable principles) by which African
slavery was abolished in the Southern States of this Union.</p>

<p class='c008'>A careful investigation of the co-operative principle will show that
it is not only possible, but perfectly simple and practicable, and that it
is full of glorious prophecy to the vast numbers who are now “ground
to the earth” by the condition of actual slavery to the ordinary demands
of nature which is entailed upon them from generation to generation,
through the operations of false systems, which were founded upon and
which are sustained by injustice and usurpation.</p>

<p class='c008'>While viewing this subject in its practical aspects, it must not be
forgotten that <i>it</i>, too, is intimately connected with progress, and subject
to its decrees.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a well-established fact that the powers of endurance of the
physical system are growing less, generation after generation, while the
mental power is increasing in about the same ratio; the legitimate deduction
from this fact is in perfect harmony with the general progressive
tendency of all things leading from the purely physical to the spiritual,
from which we may safely prophecy that the time will come
when all labor will be performed by the mind, and when it shall have
acquired perfect dominion over the material. The necessity for physical
endurance will then have ended. The tendency to such a condition,
though it has been, is, and may continue to be gradual, is nevertheless
positive and well-defined.</p>

<p class='c008'>Intimately connected with the subject of labor, and the tendency
to perform by the agency of inventions what still devolves upon the
direct application of physical strength, is that of supplying the demands
of the body. The food used now is very different from that of a hundred
years ago. Some who recognize this fact argue that the change
of diet has produced the change in the physical condition; but reasoning
from analogy, and applying the general rules of progress, leads to
the conclusion that the changes in the relative conditions of the physical
and mental, by which the latter asserts superior control, have rendered
a corresponding change of diet necessary; hence it is fair to conclude
that the change grows out of the necessities of the consumer, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>is not the producing cause in the premises; in other and general terms,
the physical system demands and should receive appropriate supplies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hundreds of people who once made use of the flesh of swine have
entirely discarded it from their boards, instinctively feeling that it does
not meet their present demands, and there is a growing distaste for it.
Common observation shows that all kinds of flesh are gradually falling
into disfavor, especially among those who labor mentally or are devoted
to spiritual things.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the physical system is gradually being relieved of labor and
the consequent waste of its energies, the character of food it requires
necessarily changes, and in the place of physical strength to be supplied
is that upon which the brain can draw to replenish its wasting stock;
the failure to recognize these demands causes very much of the dyspepsia
from which those who lead sedentary lives suffer so generally;
these should discard those articles of diet that principally contribute to
build up the material, and use such as will impart strength to the
mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are quite a number of well-authenticated cases of the actual
subsistence of the body upon the elements contained in the atmosphere
a sufficient length of time to show that it could be continued indefinitely
if the proper conditions were preserved. One of these cases in
the State of Kentucky has remained seventeen years in this condition;
one in Chicago nearly four years; there is one in Brooklyn of three
years’ duration; and a number of others from ten to sixty days. In
this condition the physical system becomes entirely renovated, purified,
and almost transparent, and the spiritual faculties intensified many fold.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO. IV.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Arguing from the fact that the character of food subsisted upon is
gradually changed from the purely physical to the more refined and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>rare, in connection with that of exceptional cases having existed, in
which supplies were drawn from entirely different sources than digested
food, leads toward the conclusion, at least, that the time will come
when men will have grown out of the necessity of supplying the wasting
energies of the body and mind by the use of food, and into that refined
spiritual condition in which he can draw directly upon the elements
which the atmosphere does or will furnish to supply all his demands.
All the arguments nature furnishes point to this condition. All
know how very important it is to have a plentiful supply of pure air;
but how far this goes toward furnishing the elements of supply demanded
by the body, the deepest inquiries have not decided.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a given case, the actual amount in weight that is furnished the
body can be determined; deducting the weight of the excretions and
palpable secretions, it is supposed the difference is consumed by some
undefined process within the body; but who can tell how much and
what the system takes directly from the atmosphere, or how much it
gives up to it, that we have no means of defining by weight or otherwise?
We also know that the atmosphere maintains an immense pressure
upon the body, and that it involuntarily resists this pressure; this
could not happen were there not some well defined and intimate relations
between the two upon which man, as the object, must be greatly
dependent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another strong and pointed argument is to be found in the process
sometimes resorted to to sustain life: in cases of great prostration of
the physical system, under exhaustive disease, when the means cannot
be supplied through the medium of the stomach and digestion, they
are furnished by being absorbed into the system through the pores of
the skin.</p>

<p class='c008'>The constant death and decay of all the materials upon which we
feed, besides all that vast amount not drawn upon directly, is continually
giving off to the atmosphere the same kind of elements which the
body retains and uses from supplies of food; as they exist in the atmosphere
in the form of elements, and there is a demand within the
body for them, it is only necessary to create and maintain the means
of supply to solve the problem. A glorious prophecy comes forth from
the tendencies of labor toward the mental, and the accompanying necessity
for modifications of diet, adapted to the many gradations man
must pass through to reach a purely spiritual condition.</p>

<p class='c008'>The physical system has been the accredited medium through
which the spirit within it—the real man—has wrought, and still is, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>all individuals who are not beyond the point where <i>spirit</i> becomes the
predominant and governing characteristic. In the present, however,
there are scattered here and there among the masses individuals who
have passed—are passing—or are approaching that point in which the
spirit, at times, acts independently of its material machine in which it has
been fostered and cultured, and gives positive proofs of an existence
within the body of an individualized life, which can and does act without
the agency of the body, and performs functions before impossible.
There are a thousand persons, at least, in this country who have a sight
entirely independent of the physical eye, which overleaps the boundaries
of physical vision; penetrates the barriers of external sense, tears off
the mask of hypocrisy and deceit, detects the motives and mainsprings
of action, and lays bare the heart of man. While comparatively but
few have attained this, all are approaching it. What does Paul mean
but this when he says, “Now we see, as through a glass, darkly; but
then face to face”? When the spirit-eye shall have fully pierced its
barriers of flesh, when the body shall have become subservient to the
spirit, instead of the spirit being dependent upon the body, when we
“shall see as we are seen, and know as we are known,” how radical the
changes, and how rapid the strides of advancement will then be!</p>

<p class='c008'>Reason for a moment upon the effect that would be produced were
every tenth person suddenly endowed with spirit-sight, and compelled
to demonstrate it by exposing the hearts and the lives of all the rest.
Where could oppression hide itself? Where could the lusts of the
flesh plot their treason against the sovereignty of the spirit, beyond the
range of <i>spirit vigilance</i>—this new safeguard of human society, the eternal
law of progress, which is now unfolding? In such a condition of
things, courts of justice, with all their attendant judges, bailiffs and attorneys-at-law,
would find their occupation gone. Prisons would be
converted into asylums and workshops for the weak and unfortunate,
and their keepers into superintendents and teachers. Churches would
be converted into lecture-rooms; and preachers, now hurling their anathemas
against unrepentant sinners, would become professors of the
great principles through and by which the world, and all things, have
been brought from the primary condition thus far on their march toward
the <i>perfect</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many individuals know that they are under the surveillance of
this spirit-sight, and demonstrate in conduct its beneficent influence;
but the capacity has not yet become sufficiently general to compel the
recognition of its efficacy by the public mind. As the rising sun first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>gilds the mountain’s loftiest peak, next the hill-top, then glides along
the inviting slope to the universal plain, where all creation rejoices
under the refulgence of its noonday glories—so comes this <i>rising
light</i>, to illumine the hearts and souls of all when it shall have reached
the zenith of its mid-day glory. As the beams reflected from the mountain
top are of the sun, and not the mountains, so are these spiritual
rays of the spiritual sun, and not of the individual reflecting them, or
through whom they may chance to shine. Verily, verily, I say unto
you, this people vaunteth and puffeth itself with knowledge, but wisdom
hath surely departed to the lowly ones of earth! Religion, clad
in its robes “of purple and fine linen,” faring “sumptuously every day,”
forgetting that Christ was cradled in a manger, and that His disciples
were fishermen, continually cries, as did the “Pharisees and hypocrites”
of old: “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The time is not far distant when the possession of spirit-sight will
be accounted of the first importance, not to those only who possess it,
but to the public generally, and will be sought for and made practical
to the honor of its possessors and to the inestimable benefit of all. The
time will come in the not far distant future when those who now cry
out, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” will bow, with becoming
humility, before the later-day <i>fishermen</i>; for these will then occupy
the places of public trust, and spirit-telegraphy, having superseded
material wires, will convey the commands of God’s accredited ministers
from the central seat of Power throughout the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where are all the great of the <i>past</i>; its orators, philosophers and statesmen;
Confucius, Zoroaster, Moses, David, Solomon, Lycurgus, Demosthenes,
Cicero, Bonaparte, Washington, and many others, of all nations
and climes, to whom history points as having stood hundreds of years
in advance of their times? Do they still live? and, living, are they
idle? Are their minds withdrawn from subjects to which they were
devoted in this primary school-house of the children of God? Are not
their minds expanded to the comprehension of the great principles of
governmental justice? Are they not better qualified to direct legislation
<i>now</i> than the wisest among us? If they still live as spirits, if they
have had better opportunities of obtaining wisdom and knowledge pertaining
to earth-life than we—can this world avail itself of their assistance
to establish on earth the government of heaven? If the angel in
the bush were possible, why may not angels manifest the wisdom, power,
and justice of God in our legislative halls? Who will dare to assert
that they are not even now seeking another Moses to lead “His people”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>up out of Egypt? Then will the prophecies of the present have
reached consummation; then will commence the earthly reign of the
King of kings and Lord of lords, as prophesied by all the holy prophets
of the world; then old things shall pass away and all things become
new; then <i>the Christ</i> shall sit upon the throne, and from his inexhausted
fountain of love, justice shall continually flow over all the earth, “as
the waters cover the sea.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As vanish the heavy mists of the morning before the radiance of
the rising sun, so will vanish the clouds that hang around the minds of
man, and shut out the rising spiritual sun, for whose “star in the East”
<i>wise men</i> are continually watching; the sun that will rise higher and
higher, and extend its rays wider and wider, until it shall enlighten the
minds of all mankind, until the icebergs of ignorance, tradition and superstition
are dissolved which now float in the ocean of progress—society,
with its cankered, festering heart; commerce robbed of its legitimate
function; labor of its recompense, and religion of its spirituality; education
lacking wisdom, marriages forming “disunions,” and women without
rights.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the false forms of the present must yield their sway to God’s
command—“Let there be light.” The laws of God are never changed—though
old as creation—they are ever new, ever sufficient for all the
vicissitudes of life; they are ever full of wisdom, justice and love; they
are written all over the face of creation, in the bosom of the earth and
in the heart of man; they are uttered by the raging tempest that rocks
the mighty ocean; in the terrible mutterings of the earthquake; in the
fury of destructive battle, when hosts are hurled on hosts in fraternal
strife; through all these the voice of God proclaims—“Let there be
light,” and there is light.</p>

<p class='c008'>We also hear its whispers in the gentle zephyrs that stir the bursting
buds and in the blooming flowers that lift their heads to drink the
falling dew; in the hum of busy nature; in the gushing fountain; we
see it in the gambols of the bubbling brook; in the mother’s love for
the new-born life; in the father’s pride; in the unspoken joy of the
maiden’s soul, listening to the first sweet tones of love; in the
magnetic ties of human sympathy which bind all mankind in a common
brotherhood, and in the dawning light of heaven brought to earth by
the angelic hosts to usher in the reign of universal justice, peace and
love.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
